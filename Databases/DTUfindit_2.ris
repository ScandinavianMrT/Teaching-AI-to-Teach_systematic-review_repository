TI  - Supervised Fine-Tuning LLMs to Behave as Pedagogical Agents in Programming Education
LA  - eng

DO  - 10.48550/arXiv.2502.20527
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored in higher education, yet their effectiveness as teaching agents remains underexamined. In this paper, we present the development of GuideLM, a fine-tuned LLM designed for programming education. GuideLM has been integrated into the Debugging C Compiler (DCC), an educational C compiler that leverages LLMs to generate pedagogically sound error explanations. Previously, DCC relied on off-the-shelf OpenAI models, which, while accurate, often over-assisted students by directly providing solutions despite contrary prompting. To address this, we employed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of 528 student-question/teacher-answer pairs, creating two models: GuideLM and GuideLM-mini, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-4o and 4o-mini, respectively. We conducted an expert analysis of 400 responses per model, comparing their pedagogical effectiveness against base OpenAI models. Our evaluation, grounded in constructivism and cognitive load theory, assessed factors such as conceptual scaffolding, clarity, and Socratic guidance. Results indicate that GuideLM and GuideLM-mini improve pedagogical performance, with an 8% increase in Socratic guidance and a 58% improvement in economy of words compared to GPT-4o. However, this refinement comes at the cost of a slight reduction in general accuracy. While further work is needed, our findings suggest that fine-tuning LLMs with targeted datasets is a promising approach for developing models better suited to educational contexts.

AB  - Due to the widespread applicability of generative artificial intelligence, we have seen it adopted across many areas of education, providing universities with new opportunities, particularly in cybersecurity education. With the industry facing a skills shortage, this paper explores the use of generative artificial intelligence in higher cybersecurity education as an intelligent tutoring system to enhance factors leading to positive student outcomes. Despite its success in content generation and assessment within cybersecurity, the field’s multidisciplinary nature presents additional challenges to scalability and generalisability. We propose a solution using agents to orchestrate specialised large language models and to demonstrate its applicability in graduate level cybersecurity topics offered at a leading Australian university. We aim to show a generalisable and scalable solution to diversified educational paradigms, highlighting its relevant features, and a method to evaluate the quality of content as well as the general effectiveness of the intelligent tutoring system on subjective factors aligned with positive student outcomes. We further explore areas for future research in model efficiency, privacy, security, and scalability.

AB  - Contextualizing problems to align with student interests can significantly improve learning outcomes. However, this task often presents scalability challenges due to resource and time constraints. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 [1]offer potential solutions to these issues. This study explores the ability of GPT-4 in the contextualization of problems within CTAT [2], an authoring tool for the intelligent tutoring system, aiming to increase student engagement and enhance learning outcomes. Through iterative prompt engineering, we achieved meaningful contextualization that preserved the difficulty and original intent of the problem, thereby not altering values or overcomplicating the questions. To evaluate the effectiveness of these newly generated questions, we conducted focus groups and interviews with instructional designers. The positive assessment from the instructional designers signifies that these questions are suitable for implementation, potentially saving significant time spent on manual contextualization. Despite these promising findings, we acknowledge current limitations of our research, particularly with geometry problems, and emphasize the need for ongoing evaluation and research. Future work includes systematic studies to measure the impact of this tool on students' learning outcomes and enhancements to handle a broader range of problems.

AB  - Intent classification is a foundational element in natural language processing, enabling conversational systems to accurately interpret user intent. In educational contexts, effective intent classification within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) can significantly enhance personalized student interactions. This paper presents the intent classification module for the Learner-Aware AI (LAAI) tutor, a dialogue-based ITS designed to recognize and respond to diverse student behaviors, such as valid answers, questions, expressions of boredom, and requests for clarification. We introduce LAAIIntentD, a custom data set specifically designed for this task, containing 1,244 labeled training records and 278 evaluation records. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) LAAI-intent-classifier using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to create a lightweight yet powerful intent classifier. Our fine-tuned model achieves better overall Recall (0.86), Precision (0.85), and F1-Score (0.83) compared to GPT-based methods. GPT models with CoT and Few-Shot prompting improve Recall but sacrifice F1 scores. This highlights our model’s efficiency in balancing accuracy and scalability for ITS applications.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of advanced large language models (LLMs) including GPT, BART, BERT, and T5, fine-tuned using a specialized FAQ dataset from ESTIN, a higher education institution. The study aims to assess the performance of these LLM models in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses to common queries. These models were evaluated using key metrics such as evaluation loss (eval loss) and ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2), which measure the alignment between the generated responses and the reference answers. The experiment results show that BERT outperforms the other models, achieving a lowest eval loss and highest ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, making it the most effective model in this context. The findings underscore the potential of BERT in educational AI applications. Finally, some future research directions are discussed, including the integration of additional models and the enhancement of the FAQ dataset to further improve performance.

AB  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have revolutionized education by offering personalized learning experiences. However, as goal-oriented learning, which emphasizes efficiently achieving specific objectives, becomes increasingly important in professional contexts, existing ITSs often struggle to deliver this type of targeted learning experience. In this paper, we propose GenMentor, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework designed to deliver goal-oriented, personalized learning within ITS. GenMentor begins by accurately mapping learners' goals to required skills using a fine-tuned LLM trained on a custom goal-to-skill dataset. After identifying the skill gap, it schedules an efficient learning path using an evolving optimization approach, driven by a comprehensive and dynamic profile of learners' multifaceted status. Additionally, GenMentor tailors learning content with an exploration-drafting-integration mechanism to align with individual learner needs. Extensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate GenMentor's effectiveness in learning guidance and content quality. Furthermore, we have deployed it in practice and also implemented it as an application. Practical human study with professional learners further highlights its effectiveness in goal alignment and resource targeting, leading to enhanced personalization.

AB  - Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems have significantly advanced in providing feedback for academic essay writing. However, their predominant focus on sentence-level features highlights the need for a broader approach to AWE development. While genre-based AWE systems aim to address the socio-rhetorical complexities of writing for specific audiences and purposes, their availability remains limited. This scarcity is largely due to methodological constraints in developing robust feedback engines that effectively support discipline-specific writing needs. This article describes a new method for fine-tuning large-language models (LLM) and evaluating model performance, which we refer to as G-FiT Mapping (Genre-based FIne-Tuning with self-organizing maps). This method utilizes semi-automated annotation of genre-based functional-rhetorical units of text to efficiently fine-tune an LLM and then uses self-organizing maps to evaluate and improve network performance. The G-FiT Mapping method resulted in a new automated feedback engine for an intelligent tutoring system called Dissemity, for DISSeminating research with clarITY, that supports discipline-specific, scientific writers in writing for publication. We demonstrate use of G-Fit Mapping for establishing measurable improvements in network performance, offering implications for network interpretation, genre-based AWE, and AI-based learning systems development.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in intelligent visualization systems, especially for domain-specific applications. Integrating LLMs into visualization systems presents challenges, and we categorize these challenges into three alignments: domain problems with LLMs, visualization with LLMs, and interaction with LLMs. To achieve these alignments, we propose a framework and outline a workflow to guide the application of fine-tuned LLMs to enhance visual interactions for domain-specific tasks. These alignment challenges are critical in education because of the need for an intelligent visualization system to support beginners' self-regulated learning. Therefore, we apply the framework to education and introduce Tailor-Mind, an interactive visualization system designed to facilitate self-regulated learning for artificial intelligence beginners. Drawing on insights from a preliminary study, we identify self-regulated learning tasks and fine-tuning objectives to guide visualization design and tuning data construction. Our focus on aligning visualization with fine-tuned LLM makes Tailor-Mind more like a personalized tutor. Tailor-Mind also supports interactive recommendations to help beginners better achieve their learning goals. Model performance evaluations and user studies confirm that Tailor-Mind improves the self-regulated learning experience, effectively validating the proposed framework.

AB  - Chat interfaces for intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) enable interactivity and flexibility. However, when students interact with chat interfaces, they expect dialogue-driven navigation from the system and can express frustration and disinterest if this is not provided. Intent detection systems help students navigate within an ITS, but detecting students' intent during open-ended dialogue is challenging. We designed an intent detection system in a chatbot ITS, classifying a student's intent between continuing the current lesson or switching to a new lesson. We explore the utility of four machine learning approaches for this task - including both conventional classification approaches and fine-tuned large language models - finding that using an intent classifier introduces trade-offs around implementation cost, accuracy, and prediction time. We argue that implementing intent detection in chat interfaces can reduce frustration and support student learning.

AB  - The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.

AB  - This study investigates the design, development, and evaluation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot for teaching English conversations in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. Employing the Design and Development Research (DDR), we analyzed needs, established design principles, and iteratively refined a chatbot through experimenting various LLMs and alignment methods. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we identified the most effective LLM and its prompt combination to generate high-quality, contextually appropriate responses. Interviews with teachers provided insights into desirable system features, potential educational applications, and ethical considerations in the development and deployment of the chatbots. The design iterations yielded the importance of feedback mechanisms and customizable AI personas. Future research should explore adaptive feedback strategies, collaborative approaches with various stakeholders, and the integration of insights from human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) design. This study contributes to the growing body of research on applying LLMs in language education, providing insights and recommendations for the design, development, and evaluation of LLM-based chatbots for EFL conversation practice. As the field evolves, ongoing research and collaboration among educators, AI engineers, and other stakeholders will be essential to harness the potential of these technologies to enhance language learning experiences.

AB  - Since the conception of Large Language Models (LLMs), their areas of application have increased significantly over time. This is due to their nature of being able to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks (like question answering, text generation, text summarization, text classification etc.), which gives them flexibility in a multitude of spaces, including in Educational AI (EdAI). Despite their incredible wide range of use, LLMs are typically applied to generative AI, from text to image generation.This paper aims to apply LLMs for a classification task in EdAI, by reproposing the original PreSS (Predicting Student Success) model which makes use of more traditional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for predicting CS1 students at risk of failing or dropping out. There are two main goals for this work: the first is to identify the best and most accurate method to re-purpose LLMs for a classification task; the second is to explore and access the explainability of the model outputs. For the former we investigate different techniques for using LLMs like Few-Shot Prompting, Fine-Tuning and Transfer Learning using Gemma 2B as base model along with two different kind of prompting techniques. For the latter we focus on attention scores of LLMs transformers, aiming to understanding what are the most important features that the model considers for generating the response. The obtained results are then compared with the previous PreSS model to evaluate whether LLMs can outperform traditional ML algorithms: this paper finds that Naïve Bayes still outperforms all the others, once again confirmed as the best algorithm for predicting student success.

AB  - With increasing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) in the education industry, intelligent tutoring system (ITS) powered by AI have been widely adopted to optimize the learning experience. However, the relationship between students' engagement level of Generative AI (GenAI) and their academic performance is still under exploration. Also current popular GenAI products like ChatGPT suffer from the hallucination problem, which includes factuality, faithfulness, and maliciousness issues in the generated answer. This paper presents GPTutor, an ITS leveraging GenAI to support students' learning processes. GPTutor integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver actual and contextually rich answers aligned to student questions and intended learning outcomes (ILO). A pilot evaluation involving undergraduate and postgraduate students assessed the system's association with user experience, engagement, and academic performance. Results demonstrated that students generally recognize the effectiveness of GPTutor. Some students also provided insightful feedback on the benefits of GPTutor in improving learning efficiency and some limitations to be addressed. Notably, students with higher engagement levels showed significantly better academic performance on the final exam. This study proposed GPTutor to provide an interactive and knowledge-grounded learning experience and showed the strong association between students' engagement in GPTutor and academic performance.

By using LLMs, the study explores the automatic generation of feedback for communication-intensive tasks such as online counseling. The evaluation compares different feedback methods, including the sandwich, WWW and STATE methods, and assesses their emotional and objective impact. The results show that AI-generated feedback fulfills objective criteria better than emotional ones. Fine-tuning an open source LLM can improve both the emotional and objective quality of feedback. Furthermore, the study examines the acceptance of AI feedback among aspiring counselors, highlighting the influence of familiarity with AI on acceptance levels. Ethical considerations, including bias and hallucination, are addressed, with recommendations for risk mitigation through multi-feedback options and expert supervision. This research contributes to the understanding of the role of AI in improving digital counseling practices and highlights the need for continuous evaluation and ethical considerations.

AB  - Notwithstanding the growing advantages of incorporating Augmented Reality (AR) in science education, the pedagogical use of AR combined with Pedagogical Agents (PAs) remains underexplored. Additionally, few studies have examined the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into science education to create GAI-enhanced PAs (GPAs) that enrich the learning experiences. To address these gaps, this study designed and implemented a GPA-enhanced 5E model within AR environments to scaffold students’ science learning. A mixed-methods design was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on students’ academic achievement, cognitive load, and their perceptions of GPAs as learning aids through using the 5E model. Sixty sixth-grade students from two complete classes were randomly assigned to either an experimental group engaged in AR science learning with a GPA-enhanced 5E approach or a control group that followed the traditional 5E method. The findings revealed that the GPA-enhanced 5E approach in AR environments significantly improved students’ academic achievement and decreased cognitive load. Furthermore, students in the experimental group reported positive perceptions of the GPA-enhanced 5E method during the AR science lessons. The findings offer valuable insights for instructional designers and educators who leverage advanced educational technologies to support science learning aligned with constructivist principles.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have received much attention recently as online learning has taken off and is replacing offline instruction in many cases. It analyses user behavior and customizes personalized learning strategies for users through artificial intelligence technology. ITS encompasses a variety of entities and multiple relations, making it suitable to be represented as a graph. This perfectly aligns with the utilization of graph embedding (GE) for downstream ITS tasks. Existing GE methods cannot effectively model ITS data because the user evolution in ITS is discrete in time. The patterns of variation in user states are similar to each other but not correlated at the temporal level. Because of the hierarchical structure caused by the discrete evolution, encoding ITS data in a hyperbolic space is more sensible. We define a discrete evolution graph (DEG) to characterize ITS and propose a method called DEGE to embed it. The static nodes in a DEG are projected randomly and then transformed into hyperbolic space. Next, employ hyperbolic evolution networks to generate the embedding of dynamic nodes. The aggregated features of each node are then delivered by hyperbolic aggregation networks and are concatenated to generate the final higher-order features. To validate the superiority, design a multi-objective loss function with preserving pairwise proximity and preserving link types to train the model on several real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baselines on both question annotation and performance prediction in ITS.

AB  - Recent work exploring the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated their ability to act as general pattern machines by completing complex token sequences representing a wide array of tasks, including time-series prediction and robot control. This paper investigates whether the pattern recognition and sequence modeling capabilities of LLMs can be extended to the domain of knowledge tracing, a critical component in the development of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that tailor educational experiences by predicting learner performance over time. In an empirical evaluation across multiple real-world datasets, we compare two approaches to using LLMs for this task, zero-shot prompting and model fine-tuning, with existing, non-LLM approaches to knowledge tracing. While LLM-based approaches do not achieve state-of-the-art performance, fine-tuned LLMs surpass the performance of naive baseline models and perform on par with standard Bayesian Knowledge Tracing approaches across multiple metrics. These findings suggest that the pattern recognition capabilities of LLMs can be used to model complex learning trajectories, opening a novel avenue for applying LLMs to educational contexts. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for future research, suggesting that further refinements and a deeper understanding of LLMs' predictive mechanisms could lead to enhanced performance in knowledge tracing tasks.

AB  - High-quality conversational datasets are crucial for the successful development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) backend. Synthetic student-teacher dialogues, generated using advanced GPT-4 models, are a common strategy for creating these datasets. However, subjects like physics that entail complex calculations pose a challenge. While GPT-4 presents impressive language processing capabilities, its limitations in fundamental mathematical reasoning curtail its efficacy for such subjects. To tackle this limitation, we introduce in this paper an innovative stateful prompt design. Our design orchestrates a mock conversation where both student and tutorbot roles are simulated by GPT-4. Each student response triggers an internal monologue, or 'code soliloquy' in the GPT-tutorbot, which assesses whether its subsequent response would necessitate calculations. If a calculation is deemed necessary, it scripts the relevant Python code and uses the Python output to construct a response to the student. Our approach notably enhances the quality of synthetic conversation datasets, especially for subjects that are calculation-intensive. The preliminary Subject Matter Expert evaluations reveal that our Higgs model, a fine-tuned LLaMA model, effectively uses Python for computations, which significantly enhances the accuracy and computational reliability of Higgs' responses.

AB  - Abstract The recent rapid development in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has greatly enhanced the effectiveness of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) as tools for healthcare education. These systems hold the potential to improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes, especially for low-literacy populations such as the Hispanic community with limited reading and writing skills. However, despite the progress in pre-trained multilingual NLP models, there exists a noticeable research gap when it comes to code-switching within the medical context. Code-switching is a prevalent phenomenon in multilingual communities where individuals seamlessly transition between languages during conversations. This presents a distinctive challenge for healthcare ITS aimed at serving multilingual communities, as it demands a thorough understanding of and accurate adaptation to code-switching, which has thus far received limited attention in research. The hypothesis of our work asserts that the development of an ITS for healthcare education, culturally appropriate to the Hispanic population with frequent code-switching practices, is both achievable and pragmatic. Given that text classification is a core problem to many tasks in ITS, like sentiment analysis, topic classification, and smart replies, we target text classification as the application domain to validate our hypothesis. Our model relies on pre-trained word embeddings to offer rich representations for understanding code-switching medical contexts. However, training such word embeddings, especially within the medical domain, poses a significant challenge due to limited training corpora. In our approach to address this challenge, we identify distinct English and Spanish embeddings, each trained on medical corpora, and subsequently merge them into a unified vector space via space transformation. In our study, we demonstrate that singular value decomposition (SVD) can be used to learn a linear transformation (a matrix), which aligns monolingual vectors from two languages in a single meta-embedding. As an example, we assessed the similarity between the words "cat" and "gato" both before and after alignment, utilizing the cosine similarity metric. Prior to alignment, these words exhibited a similarity score of 0.52, whereas after alignment, the similarity score increased to 0.64. This example illustrates that aligning the word vectors in a meta-embedding enhances the similarity between these words, which share the same meaning in their respective languages. To assess the quality of the representations in our meta-embedding in the context of code-switching, we employed a neural network to conduct text classification tasks on code-switching datasets. Our results demonstrate that, compared to pre-trained multilingual models, our model can achieve high performance in text classification tasks while utilizing significantly fewer parameters.

AB  - The rapid advancements in large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their static knowledge bases limit their applicability in dynamic, domain-specific, and personalized contexts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems address this challenge by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models to deliver real-time, contextually enriched responses. This paper implements LearnRAG, an open-source RAG framework for personalized learning that is modular in architecture, hybrid in retrieval, and fine-tuned for generation to produce adaptive educational content. A holistic case study of LearnRAG showed scalability, efficiency, increasing learner engagement, and reducing educators&#x0027; workload. Issues such as multimodal integration, content accuracy, and learning styles are discussed, and strategies for ethical deployment are developed. LearnRAG offers a robust, scalable, and adaptive platform to meet the evolving needs of learners and educators worldwide, representing a paradigm shift in GenAI-driven education.

AB  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are fundamental to modern web development, yet many learners encounter significant challenges with its intricate syntax and extensive styling capabilities. Approximately 85.7% of students report difficulties in mastering CSS concepts, which are often compounded by motivational issues that hinder the learning process. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a web-based educational application designed to enhance CSS learning through the integration of an innovative pedagogical agent that employs advanced scaffolding methods. The application utilizes a dual-phase scaffolding approach, including procedural scaffolding, which offers structured guidance through pre-designed dialogues, and strategic scaffolding, which employs ChatGPT to deliver personalized, adaptive feedback tailored to individual learning needs. The implementation of these scaffolding techniques has led to significant improvements in both user engagement and learning outcomes. Thematic analysis revealed that 80% of participants found the learning style provided by the pedagogical agent aligned with their personal preferences, compared to only 40% with conventional methods. Additionally, 90% of participants experienced increased motivation using the application with the pedagogical agent, versus 40% with the conventional approach. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pedagogical agent in fostering a personalized and engaging learning experience, enhancing both motivation and learning. This research lays the chance for future advancements in interactive and adaptive learning systems, demonstrating the potential of combining pedagogical agents with sophisticated language models like ChatGPT to address educational and motivational challenges.

AB  - The advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can provide opportunities for enriching educational experiences, but at the same time raise concerns regarding academic integrity. Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner.

DO  - 10.48550/arXiv.2505.06418
AB  - Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on scientific reasoning tasks (e.g., ScienceQA). However, most existing benchmarks focus narrowly on the accuracy of the final answer while ignoring other metrics. In particular, when applying MLLMs to educational contexts, the goal is not only correctness but also the ability to teach. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates MLLMs as science tutors using a comprehensive educational rubric and a simulated student model that judges the teaching performance of the tutors. Given a list of candidate MLLM science tutors, we use rubric-based student judgments to produce a range of tutor performance scores, identifying both strong and weak tutors. Using the training section of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise comparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors. This enables us to apply multiple preference optimization methods to fine-tune an underperforming tutor model (Qwen2-VL-2B) into more effective ones. Our results also show that strong problem-solving skills do not guarantee high-quality tutoring and that performance optimization-guided refinements can yield more educationally aligned tutor models. This approach opens avenues for building MLLMs that serve not only as problem solvers, but as genuinely helpful educational assistants.

AB  - In the era of globalization and information technology, English is becoming more and more important as the main language of international communication, but the traditional English teaching model is difficult to meet the diverse needs of learners due to the uneven distribution of resources and the lack of personalized tutoring. In order to meet these challenges, this study uses a generative pre-training model to build an intelligent tutoring system for English teaching, aiming to innovate the English learning experience with the help of artificial intelligence technology and achieve personalized and efficient teaching guidance. The construction solution includes collecting data such as learners' English proficiency test scores, learning history, and self-reported learning preferences to create detailed learner profiles, integrating advanced generative pre-trained models such as GPT-based and fine-tuning with data related to English language teaching, and then automatically generating exercises based on learner profiles and dynamically adjusting the difficulty. The application of the system is reflected in the integration of natural language processing technology and generative models to provide immediate feedback after learners complete the exercises, such as analyzing the grammar, vocabulary use and coherence of English passages and pointing out mistakes, giving suggestions and explanations for corrections, as well as providing intelligent tutoring in the form of dialogues, such as examples, comparisons and related exercises to enhance understanding in response to learners' questions about grammar points. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional teaching mode, the use of this intelligent tutoring system increases the learners' progress in English listening, speaking, reading and writing by an average of 30 %, and the learning satisfaction increases by 40 %, especially in the improvement of oral expression and writing skills.

AB  - For a long time, Chinese language teachers in primary and secondary schools have been confronting challenges of heavy workload, low efficiency, and difficulty in improving the quality of composition evaluations. This article introduces “ELion”, an intelligent Chinese composition tutoring system based on large language models. The system utilizes deep linguistic features to evaluate the quality of compositions and provide interpretable feedback. By discussing the overall design, evaluation framework structure, and scoring algorithm principles of ELion, this paper addresses the theoretical, technical, and engineering issues of intelligent evaluation of Chinese compositions in the educational context. Small-scale experiments conducted in schools demonstrate that ELion performs well in language error detection, rhetorical techniques, and the expression of actions and emotions. It can basically meet the needs of Chinese language teaching in primary and secondary schools. In the future, ELion will further develop algorithms for ”instruction-learning-evaluation” alignment assessment, and personalized precise feedback generation, based on the GPT model. This will improve the evaluation effectiveness in topic analysis, text structure, and genuine emotional expression. Additionally, systematic field experiments for the system will be conducted to explore the application of artificial intelligence in education.

AB  - Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized learning and support is becoming a promising tool in computing education. AI Assistants can help students with programming, problem-solving, converse with them to clarify course content, explain error messages to help with debugging, and much more. However, using cloud-based LLMs poses risks around data security, privacy, but also control of the overarching system. To address these concerns, we created a locally-stored Small Language Model (SLM) that leverages different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. We compare one SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 - fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1) against two popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) to see the viability for computing educators to use in their course(s). We use conversations from a CS1 course (N = 1,260), providing students with an AI Assistant (using gpt-3.5-turbo) to help them learn content and support problem-solving while completing their Python programming assignment. In total, we had 269 students use the AI Assistant, with a total of 1,988 questions asked. Using this real conversational data, we re-ran student questions using our novel SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 testing nine different RAG methods) and gpt-4-32k, then compared those results against the original gpt-3.5-turbo responses. Our findings indicate that using an SLM with RAG can perform similarly, if not better, than LLMs. This shows that it is possible for computing educators to use SLMs (with RAG) in their course(s) as a tool for scalable learning, supporting content understanding and problem-solving needs, while employing their own policies on data privacy and security.

AB  - Generative AI (GenAI) holds the potential to revolutionise marketing education by enhancing the learning experience and addressing long-standing pedagogical challenges. This paper explores the transformative impact of GenAI, focusing on three primary dimensions: cost efficiency & scalability, personalisation & accessibility, and creativity & innovation. However, despite these substantial benefits, GenAI also presents important risks and challenges. I therefore underscore the need for strategic and responsible implementation, recommending several approaches such as foundational AI literacy, human oversight, alignment with learning objectives and bespoke pedagogical frameworks to harness GenAI's full potential while mitigating associated risks. Finally, I emphasise that the discussion should evolve from whether we should use GenAI to when and how we should use it.

TI  - BD at BEA 2025 Shared Task: MPNet Ensembles for Pedagogical Mistake Identification and Localization in AI Tutor Responses

AB  - We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification) and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

TI  - CoderAgent: Simulating Student Behavior for Personalized Programming Learning with Large Language Models
LA  - eng

DO  - 10.48550/arXiv.2505.20642
AB  - Personalized programming tutoring, such as exercise recommendation, can enhance learners' efficiency, motivation, and outcomes, which is increasingly important in modern digital education. However, the lack of sufficient and high-quality programming data, combined with the mismatch between offline evaluation and real-world learning, hinders the practical deployment of such systems. To address this challenge, many approaches attempt to simulate learner practice data, yet they often overlook the fine-grained, iterative nature of programming learning, resulting in a lack of interpretability and granularity. To fill this gap, we propose a LLM-based agent, CoderAgent, to simulate students' programming processes in a fine-grained manner without relying on real data. Specifically, we equip each human learner with an intelligent agent, the core of which lies in capturing the cognitive states of the human programming practice process. Inspired by ACT-R, a cognitive architecture framework, we design the structure of CoderAgent to align with human cognitive architecture by focusing on the mastery of programming knowledge and the application of coding ability. Recognizing the inherent patterns in multi-layered cognitive reasoning, we introduce the Programming Tree of Thought (PTOT), which breaks down the process into four steps: why, how, where, and what. This approach enables a detailed analysis of iterative problem-solving strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that CoderAgent provides interpretable insights into learning trajectories and achieves accurate simulations, paving the way for personalized programming education.

AB  - As AI tools become common across jobs and industries, it is critical to broaden education about AI beyond teaching computer scientists how to build AI systems. To expand AI education, we are researching AI for AI learning: a personalized and adaptive learning system that integrates dialog-based tutoring and gamified programming activities. To study this problem, we adapted and expanded an existing smartphone adaptive coach to develop the Game-if-AI system. Using a design-based research approach, Game-if-AI was iteratively tested and improved across four semesters of optional use in a course designed for technician-level understanding of AI: mastering programming skills to apply AI libraries and established models. In this study, we measured the interests and needs of these technical learners, based on both survey data and on how they engaged with topics in the system. Based on this data, new topics were added and the system was refined. In this paper, we report students' usability ratings for system components and student preferences based on completion rates of AI topics available each semester. Students rated the adaptive system positively overall (93% rated as a "good idea"), but more complex learning activities (tutoring dialogs, programming) were rated lower than traditional ones (e.g., multiple choice, reading). Students were most likely to master topics highly aligned to the course materials, as well as self-directed learning toward easier high-interest topics (e.g., LLM Prompting).

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in educational tasks such as providing writing suggestions to students. Despite their potential, LLMs are known to harbor inherent biases which may negatively impact learners. Previous studies have investigated bias in models and data representations separately, neglecting the potential impact of LLM bias on human writing. In this paper, we investigate how bias transfers through an AI writing support pipeline. We conduct a large-scale user study with 231 students writing business case peer reviews in German. Students are divided into five groups with different levels of writing support: one classroom group with feature-based suggestions and four groups recruited from Prolific - a control group with no assistance, two groups with suggestions from fine-tuned GPT-2 and GPT-3 models, and one group with suggestions from pre-trained GPT-3.5. Using GenBit gender bias analysis, Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT), and Sentence Embedding Association Test (SEAT) we evaluate the gender bias at various stages of the pipeline: in model embeddings, in suggestions generated by the models, and in reviews written by students. Our results demonstrate that there is no significant difference in gender bias between the resulting peer reviews of groups with and without LLM suggestions. Our research is therefore optimistic about the use of AI writing support in the classroom, showcasing a context where bias in LLMs does not transfer to students' responses.

AB  - This study, conducted at Complutense Intermedia-Lab, employs a dual approach to explore university students’ use of Generative AI (GenAI), combining a survey with foresight methodologies (Sci-fi prototyping). The initial survey gathers baseline data on students’ experiences, attitudes, and concerns regarding GenAI, providing a comprehensive understanding of current practices among university students in Spain. This empirical foundation informs subsequent Sci-fi prototyping sessions, where students creatively envision future scenarios, fostering futurist thinking and deeper engagement. By integrating principles of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), this approach facilitates a nuanced exploration of GenAI’s potential impacts on education. The incorporation of both quantitative data collection and qualitative foresight methods in this study serves to navigate challenges and level opportunities of promoting the ethical and inclusive incorporation of GenAI in Higher Education, ensuring that future innovations align with societal values and needs.

AB  - Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for scalable educational applications, but their use in dialog-based tutoring systems remains challenging due to the need for effective pedagogical strategies and the high costs associated with expert-curated datasets. Our study explores the use of smaller, more affordable LLMs for one-on-one tutoring in the context of solving reading comprehension problems. We developed a synthetic tutoring dialog dataset, evaluated by human teachers, and fine-tuned a smaller LLM using this dataset. Furthermore, we conducted an interactive experiment comparing the performance of the fine-tuned model with a larger model in real-world tutoring scenarios. Our results show that the fine-tuned model performs on par with the larger model but at a lower cost, demonstrating a viable, cost-effective approach for implementing LLM-based tutoring systems in educational settings.

DO  - 10.48550/arXiv.2505.15607
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's instructional planning.

AB  - Reflection is widely recognized as a cornerstone of student development, fostering critical thinking, self-regulation, and deep conceptual understanding. Traditionally, reflective skills are cultivated through structured feedback, mentorship, and guided self-assessment. However, these approaches often face challenges such as limited scalability, difficulties in delivering individualized feedback, and a shortage of instructors proficient in facilitating meaningful reflection. This study pioneers the exploration of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), as an innovative solution to these limitations. By leveraging the capacity of LLMs to provide personalized, context-sensitive feedback at scale, this research examines their potential to serve as effective facilitators of reflective exercises, maintaining the depth of engagement and promoting critical thinking. Through an in-depth analysis of prompt engineering strategies and the efficacy of LLMs in simulated multi-turn dialogues between tutors and students, this study demonstrates that, with pedagogically aligned prompts, LLMs can function as accessible and adaptive tools for automating reflective guidance and objectively assessing the performance of both tutors and students. This work also contributes to the evolving understanding of AI's role in reflective pedagogy and highlights new possibilities for AI-driven intelligent tutoring systems.

AB  - This study presents the design and development of the 21st Century Teacher Educator for Ghana GPT, a customized Generative AI (GenAI) tool created using OpenAI's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Interactive Semi-Automated Prompting Strategy (ISA). Anchored in a Glocalized design approach, this tool supports pre-service teachers (PSTs) in Ghana by embedding localized linguistic, cultural, and curricular content within globally aligned principles of ethical and responsible AI use. The model utilizes structured, preloaded datasets-including Ghana's National Teacher Education Curriculum Framework (NTECF), UNESCO's (2023) AI guidelines, and culturally responsive pedagogies-to offer curriculum-aligned, linguistically adaptive, and pedagogically grounded learning support. The ISA enables users to input their institution, year, and semester, generating tailored academic content such as lecture notes, assessment practice, practicum resources, and action research guidance. The design incorporates the Culture and Context-Aware Framework, GenAI-CRSciA, and frameworks addressing GenAI neocolonialism to ensure equity, curriculum fidelity, and local relevance. Pilot implementation revealed notable strengths in language adaptation and localization, delivering bilingual support in English and Ghanaian languages like Twi, Dagbani, Mampruli, and Dagaare, with contextualized examples for deeper understanding. The GPT also generated practice assessments aligned with course objectives, reinforcing learner engagement. Challenges included occasional hallucinations due to limited corpora in some indigenous languages and access barriers tied to premium subscriptions. This design case contributes to discourse on Glocalized GenAI and calls for collaboration with OpenAI NextGen to expand access and empirically assess usage across diverse African educational contexts.

AB  - Generative AI assistants are AI-powered applications that can provide personalized responses to user queries or prompts. A variety of AI assistants have recently been released, and among the most popular is OpenAI's ChatGPT. In this work-in-progress in innovative practice, we explore evidence-based learning strategies and the integration of Generative AI for computer science and engineering education. We expect this research will lead to innovative pedagogical approaches to enhance undergraduate computer science and engineering education. In particular, we describe how ChatGPT was used in two computing-based courses: a Junior-level course in database systems and a Senior-level class in mobile application development. We identify four evidence-based learning strategies: well-defined learning goals, authentic learning experiences, structured learning progression, and strategic assessment. We align these strategies with the two aforementioned courses and evaluate the usefulness of ChatGPT specifically in achieving the learning goals. Combining Generative AI with evidence-based learning has the potential to transform modern education into a more personalized learning experience.

AB  - Comprehensive school health education (HE), despite its link to enhancing both student health and academic achievement, often faces barriers to effective implementation. As pedagogical strategies evolve to integrate traditional methods with technological innovations like artificial intelligence (AI), the adoption of innovation in HE preparation and instruction becomes vital to maintain its relevance and increase student achievement. Leveraging generative AI holds immense promise for enhancing the HE curriculum, instruction, assessment, and learning environment. Presently available AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can facilitate dynamic generation and adaptive modification of the HE curriculum, incorporating best practices such as backward design, standards-based alignment, and a focus on skill development. AI technology can also enhance inclusivity and equity by developing curricula that incorporate academic supports and principles such as Universal Design for Learning to better tailor lessons to accommodate student needs. Assessment can be improved through the creation and modification of unique formative and summative evaluations. Additionally, supplemental activities and teaching strategies can be generated tailored to identified areas of growth. Finally, AI holds immense promise for multi-subject standard integration and collaboration aligning with the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child model. Through the considerate use of AI, educators can foster a more responsive and effective HE learning environment that aligns with the diverse and evolving needs of students.

AB  - This exploratory study investigates the convergence of marketing communications and AI-powered technology in higher education, adopting a perspective on student interactions with generative AI tools. Through a comprehensive content analysis of learners’ responses, we employed a blend of manual scrutiny, Python-generated Word Cloud, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to expose the nature of interaction between learners and AI tools. Our findings indicate that learners predominantly adhere to the perception of AI as a tool resembling a ‘brush’ in the creative process, rather than as an active co-creator – the percaption that is aligned with the conventional tool-user dynamic. Students articulated a dual narrative regarding AI: they acknowledged its utility in enhancing creativity, yet expressed concerns about overreliance potentially eroding their own creative skills. Heidegger’s exploration of different modes of ‘revealing’ and Deleuze and Guattari’s notions of desiring machines and machinic enslavement suggest an alternative perspective where technology, and by extension AI-empowered technology, can contribute to a deeper existential understanding. This study points out the possibility of moving beyond a simple tool-user model, suggesting the emergence of more complex plausible scenarios of interaction: poietic symbiosis or algorithmic subjugation.

It involves tailoring LLMs baseline prompts and comparing the results of a control group receiving standard content and an experimental group receiving learning styletailored content. Preliminary results suggest that GPT-4 can generate responses aligned with various learning styles, indicating the potential for enhanced engagement and comprehension. However, these results also reveal challenges, including the model's tendency for sycophantic behavior and variability in responses. Our findings suggest that a more sophisticated approach is required for integrating AI into education (AIEd) to improve educational outcomes.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring system (ITS) provides learners with step-by-step problem-solving support through scaffolding. Most ITSs have been developed in the USA and incorporate American instructional strategies. How do non-American students perceive and use ITS with different native problem-solving strategies? The present study compares Stoich Tutor, an ITS with a high level of scaffolding, with ORCCA, an ITS with dynamic scaffolds that can support a range of problem-solving strategies. We conducted a think-aloud study with university students in the USA (N = 10) and Germany (N = 11), where students worked with either Stoich Tutor and ORCCA before solving stoichiometry problems on paper. Two human coders derived a coding scheme to investigate the strategies American and German students employ during problem solving on paper without instructional support. We derive a taxonomy of three stoichiometry problem-solving strategies. Next to the American factor labeling method, this taxonomy includes a strategy based on equation transformations and a previously undocumented strategy using abstract symbols to isolate a target variable and then pluck in given values and compute the solution. German students exclusively used the latter strategy, which was not explicitly supported by any of the two tutoring systems. Further, students who did not use the factor-label method for paper-based problem solving, most of whom were German, initially had difficulty setting appropriate goals and working with fractions in the Stoich Tutor. While German students preferred ORCCA based on short interviews, they more often successfully solved problems in Stoich Tutor. Therefore, Stoich Tutor, although misaligned with German instruction, could still support German students’ learning. Still, revisions to ITS based on local instructional cultures could make them potentially more effective and aligned with curricular goals.

AB  - Rapid advances in artificial intelligence are transforming high-stakes fields like medicine and education while raising pressing ethical challenges. This paper introduces the Ethical Firewall Architecture—a comprehensive framework that embeds mathematically provable ethical constraints directly into AI decision-making systems. By integrating formal verification techniques, blockchain-inspired cryptographic immutability, and emotion-like escalation protocols that trigger human oversight when needed, the architecture ensures that every decision is rigorously certified to align with core human values before implementation. The framework also addresses emerging issues, such as biased value systems in large language models and the risks associated with accelerated AI learning. In addition, it highlights the potential societal impacts—including workforce displacement—and advocates for new oversight roles like the Ethical AI Officer. The findings suggest that combining rigorous mathematical safeguards with structured human intervention can deliver AI systems that perform efficiently while upholding transparency, accountability, and trust in critical applications.

AB  - This study evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an Artificial Intelligence-based tutor for a university course. In particular, different advanced techniques are utilized, such as prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. We assessed the different models and applied techniques using common similarity metrics like BLEU-4, ROUGE, and BERTScore, complemented by a small human evaluation of helpfulness and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate that RAG combined with prompt engineering significantly enhances model responses and produces better factual answers. In the context of education, RAG appears as an ideal technique as it is based on enriching the input of the model with additional information and material which usually is already present for a university course. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, can produce quite small, still strong expert models, but poses the danger of overfitting. Our study further asks how we measure performance of LLMs and how well current measurements represent correctness or relevance? We find high correlation on similarity metrics and a bias of most of these metrics towards shorter responses. Overall, our research points to both the potential and challenges of integrating LLMs in educational settings, suggesting a need for balanced training approaches and advanced evaluation frameworks.

AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies, such as cloud computing, machine learning, and AI, have improved productivity but introduced challenges in workforce training and reskilling. This is critical given existing workforce shortages, especially in marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), who often lack access to quality education. Addressing these challenges, this research presents gAI-PT4I4, a Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0, designed to personalize 4IR experiential learning. gAI-PT4I4 employs sentiment analysis to assess student comprehension, leveraging generative AI and finite automaton to tailor learning experiences. The framework integrates low-fidelity Digital Twins for VR-based training, featuring an Interactive Tutor - a generative AI assistant providing real-time guidance via audio and text. It uses zero-shot sentiment analysis with LLMs and prompt engineering, achieving 86\% accuracy in classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables personalized learning content grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To adapt training dynamically, finite automaton structures exercises into states of increasing difficulty, requiring 80\% task-performance accuracy for progression. Experimental evaluation with 22 volunteers showed improved accuracy exceeding 80\%, reducing training time. Finally, this paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, aligning Digital Twin complexity with Bloom's Taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's model, providing a scalable educational framework.

AB  - In this study, we explore the efficacy of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in the tasks of constructing and completing Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs). Knowledge Graphs (KGs) help represent real-world relationships. This can take the form of modeling course domains and student progression in educational settings. Through this work, we leverage GPT-4 to aid KG construction and align it with predefined learning objectives, course structure, and human interaction in validating and refining the generated KGs. The methodology employed utilized prompting LLMs with course materials and evaluating the generation of KGs through automatic and human assessment. Through a series of experiments, we show the potential of LLMs in enhancing the EduKG construction process, particularly for course modeling. Our findings suggest that LLMs such as GPT-4 can augment EduKGs by suggesting valuable and contextually relevant triplets. This KG creation and augmentation approach shows the potential to reduce the workload on educators and adaptive learning systems, paving the way for future applications in content recommendation and personalized learning experiences.

AB  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are designed to aid and enhance the teaching and learning process in a specific field of knowledge while acknowledging the uniqueness of each learner. Chatbots are becoming increasingly prevalent in contemporary life, with applications ranging from personal assistants on mobile devices to providing technical assistance over the phone lines in various sectors, including business, retail, health, and education. Unlike other fields, the application of chatbots in education requires careful pedagogical considerations. This article outlines a theoretical framework and theories used in developing a chatbot for the Malaysian University English Test (MUET) learning and testing, incorporating the ELTC (Education, Learning, Teaching, and Communication) Framework. The four underpinning theories of the theoretical framework in this study are education theory, language theory, technology theory, and communicative theory. The education theory adopted in this study is Lev Vygotsky's Social Constructivist Theory, aligning with the ELTC Framework's focus on active learning and interaction. The language theory involved is Krashen's Second Language Acquisition. Meanwhile, the technology theory includes Bower's Technology-Mediated Learning Theory and George Siemens's Connectivism Theory, resonating with the ELTC Framework's emphasis on utilizing technology for effective learning. The communicative theory, which highlights Social Presence Theory, underscores the importance of meaningful interaction in language learning. The suggested theoretical framework may be utilized as a reference for developing chatbot intelligent teaching systems. The chatbot can be expanded to other courses in future research. The assessment of the chatbot could be conducted with different participants and customized to meet the requirements of various learners with varying levels of language proficiency.

AB  - In secondary language education, one tool used by teachers to test students' language ability is reading comprehension. The construction of these problems can take a lot of time as the text needs to contain only the vocabulary and grammar the students know, and the questions also need to test the reasoning skills the teachers want to evaluate. To allow educators to use reading comprehension exercises more frequently, this research aims to alleviate the time constraint of creating these questions by training a controllable transformer-based natural language processing model to create questions of varying types and about a passage of text as specified by the user. After fine-tuning, the questions generated using the new controls either suffered from overfitting or from a lack of diversity between them, however the output of an existing question generation control was altered and became capable of generating questions suitable for use in reading comprehension. To improve the output of the new controls, more data could be used in the training, or an alternative training scheme would need to be utilized.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel approach for distilling math word problem solving capabilities from large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student models. Our approach is designed to consider the student model's weaknesses and foster a tailored learning experience by generating targeted exercises aligned with educational science principles, such as knowledge tracing and personalized learning. Concretely, we let GPT-3 be a math tutor and run two steps iteratively: 1) assessing the student model's current learning status on a GPT-generated exercise book, and 2) improving the student model by training it with tailored exercise samples generated by GPT-3. Experimental results reveal that our approach outperforms LLMs (e.g., GPT-3 and PaLM) in accuracy across three distinct benchmarks while employing significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the various components within our methodology to substantiate their efficacy.

AB  - As student learning transitions to being increasingly 24/7, online courses struggle to provide support for learners on the same schedule. Human TAs are bound by time constraints and are often available only during limited working hours. This can result in a wait time for students seeking answers to their coursework questions. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this need by developing a Virtual Teaching Assistant (TA) that leverages OpenAI’s text embeddings to format and search for data and GPT to adapt the style and content of its responses to align with the typical discourse found in a discussion forum. Our virtual TA, JeepyTA, offers round-the-clock assistance to students, much more rapidly addressing their academic queries. Although still limited in what it can respond to, JeepyTA provides students with responses to their logistic, conceptual, and programming questions, tailored to specific courses. In this paper, we outline the development process, discuss the results, and outline our future plans for a more generalized and versatile Virtual TA catering to a broader range of courses and their differing learning support needs.

AB  - Mathematical word problems (MWPs) involve the task of converting textual descriptions into mathematical equations. This poses a significant challenge in natural language processing, particularly for low-resource languages such as Bengali. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an innovative approach to solving Bengali MWPs using transformer-based models, including Basic Transformer, mT5, BanglaT5, and mBART50. To support this effort, the "PatiGonit" dataset was introduced, containing 10,000 Bengali math problems, and these models were fine-tuned to translate the word problems into equations accurately. The evaluation revealed that the mT5 model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.30%, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer models in this domain. This research marks a significant step forward in Bengali natural language processing, offering valuable methodologies and resources for educational AI tools. By improving math education, it also supports the development of advanced problem-solving skills for Bengali-speaking students.

AB  - &lt;p&gt;The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) plays a pivotal role in driving advancements and innovation in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) due to its remarkable capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and generating. Further refinement can enrich the model's understanding of domain-specific knowledge, and enhances the capabilities of GPT for AIED. However, there was a lack of studies closely incorporate the application of the GPT and AI with educational theories. Some research studies have been extensively explored and yielded favorable results. For instance, the integration of AI with Open Learner Models (OLMs) implements AIED that provides learners with insights into their progress and aligns with their learning objectives. Despite these, existing methods still encounter several challenges that impact their practicality. Such as, employing a single neural network to store OLM's data renders continuously modifying difficult, as well as hinders scalability to encompass larger knowledge without substantial augmentation of the neural network's capacity. Furthermore, given the semantics explicitly represented within the OLM, the neural network encounters difficulties in comprehending the nuanced interdependencies among them. These challenges can result in suboptimal performance when generating meaningful insights from the data in AI tasks, and they can also lead to security issues. To address these challenges, we introduce the first Multi-modal Embedding Open Learner Model (MeOLM) framework, which integrates course embeddings, OLM embeddings, multi-modal embedding module, and task-specific modules. It works with GPT to enhance personalized learning. It maps OLM's data with implicit neural networks as multi-modal embeddings.

This facilitates the rapid allocation and access of embeddings, which in turn benefits downstream tasks such as knowledge graph completion, relation extraction, and dynamic embeddings management. Furthermore, we integrating the MeOLM with Biggs' constructive alignment, which holds significant influence in education, to align the learning objectives of a subject with its Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) activities and assessments.

AB  - Current research aims to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for tutoring beginning programming students efficiently and at scale. Students often struggle to interact effectively with LLMs to obtain meaningful feedback. We introduce an LLM-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) with a structured interface and prompts aligned with Hattie's feedback model. To provide more focused feedback, we utilize the user interaction history for context. Additionally, we explore the question of proactivity.
A user study with 9 participants compared history-based and current-state feedback methods using ChatGPT, showing a preference for history-based feedback in 69% of cases and with higher usefulness ratings (M = 7.57 vs. M = 4.1, p = 0.03 (statistically significant at p < 0.05)). This effect became more pronounced in later learning stages. For proactivity, we collected user data from the study, where participants explicitly requested feedback, and trained a neural network (NN) to predict optimal feedback timing. While the model achieved 97% accuracy on test data, the small sample size (N = 10) and the use of oversampling limit its generalizability. Future work will refine history-based feedback with eye-tracking data and integrate NN-driven proactive behavior to further enhance the effectiveness of LLM-based ITS in programming education.

AB  - The transformative potential of Generative AI (GenAI) in higher education necessitates a critical examination of its ethical integration, particularly in fostering sex-gender equity and ensuring human-centric innovation. This paper addresses the multifaceted impact of GenAI, exploring both its opportunities and the ethical challenges it presents within educational contexts. As AI technologies, including large language models and diffusion models, rapidly advance, concerns regarding bias, privacy, accountability, and explainability in their application to educational settings must be addressed. It argues that ethical considerations must guide the integration of AI into educational systems, with a particular focus on gender equity and the promotion of inclusive learning environments. The rise of personalized learning, facilitated by AI systems, offers vast potential for tailoring educational experiences to individual needs. However, it also raises significant risks, including algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and the unintended misuse of AI technologies by students in ways that may perpetuate social inequities or ethical lapses. It underscores the urgent need for higher education institutions to address the ethics education gap, ensuring that students are not only equipped with cutting-edge technical knowledge but also a deep understanding of the societal and ethical implications of AI technologies. To bridge this gap, we propose practical strategies for the ethical integration of GenAI in education. These include project-based learning, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and comprehensive faculty development programs aimed at embedding ethical decision-making frameworks within AI curricula. By cultivating a cultural ethical responsibility, higher education can foster an environment where AI innovation is pursued with a commitment to social justice, diversity, and inclusion. Rooted in the X.0 wave, which highlights the evolution of technological paradigms from traditional models to the next wave of innovation, this paper aligns with the principles of Industry X.0 (when X.0 = 5.0). This theory emphasizes humancentric innovation, sustainability, and ethical responsibility as foundational elements for future technological advancements. In this context, it provides a roadmap for the responsible use of AI in education, advocating for the integration of human welfare as a guiding principle in AI-driven innovation. This ensures that AI technologies are utilized as tools for advancing societal well-being rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. By applying X.0 theory, this research calls for a paradigm shift in higher education - one that prioritizes ethical AI education and prepares students to lead with responsibility, equity, and integrity as they navigate the evolving technological landscape.

AB  - We propose a collaborative hybrid (human plus artificial intelligence) learning, which enhances learning impact with additional elements. These elements are: collective intelligence, created by integrating large language models (LLMs) into argumentation to strengthen students in various roles; adversarial learning, where competition between students is built on the principles of generative adversarial networks around complex decision objectives (dilemmas) towards developing resilience skills. We conduct an experiment, structured as a series of intellectual sparring between teams of players. The scenario of sparring evolved from classical disputes to technologically augmented competitions. The core hypotheses, “positive impact of adversarial training” and “game-changer role of LLMs in argumentation”, have been confirmed. An important conclusion is that the added value of LLM tools strongly depends on how professionally they are used. Achieved results are presented as a contribution to collaborative hybrid learning using artificial intelligence as a personal digital assistant.

AB  - Teachers who wish to enact lessons about generative AI are required to simultaneously learn about it and develop curricula with activities that align with their discipline. We present two cases of high school teachers, June and Margot, who had different prior experiences, resources, and learning goals related to GenAI instruction. We found that they designed lessons that positioned GenAI as an object-of-study or subject-specific, but neither lesson solely focused on either approach. Prior disciplinary and lesson planning knowledge and in-the moment student reactions to activities shaped their appraisals of lesson effectiveness. However, we observed that co-design experiences and activities were central for helping to develop teachers’ pedagogical design capacity for GenAI. We contribute two cases that illustrate how co-design can support high school teachers who wish to integrate GenAI into their discipline, and by offering contrasting models of pedagogical approaches.

AB  - With the rapid rise of AI technologies such as ChatGPT, understanding and integrating AI into K-12 education has become increasingly important. However, teachers often lack the AI literacy necessary to navigate these tools, which can lead to the perpetuation of misconceptions and biases in the classroom. This study seeks to identify K-12 teachers' self-identified needs regarding AI education and compare them with existing research on professional development (PD) for AI integration. We surveyed 34 K-12 teachers to assess their knowledge of AI, identify areas where they require further support, and evaluate the relevance of current PD offerings. Our findings reveal a significant disconnect between the top-down assumptions of expert-driven PD initiatives and the practical needs articulated by teachers. Key themes emerged, including a diverse range of AI understanding among educators, a strong preference for hands-on, practical training, and a demand for ongoing institutional support. Additionally, teachers expressed a desire for collaborative learning environments to share strategies and experiences related to AI. This study underscores the importance of tailoring PD programs to address the unique contexts and challenges faced by educators, advocating for a more personalized approach that fosters confidence and competence in AI integration. By aligning PD offerings with teachers' needs, we aim to enhance their ability to effectively utilize AI tools in the classroom, ultimately enriching the educational experience for students.

AB  - Introduction: Adaptive learning platforms offer innovative teaching approaches by tailoring educational content to individual learner’s needs, abilities, and paces. Methods: This study investigates the effects of an adaptive digital learning platform on user experience, motivation, and learning outcomes among 56 sixth-grade students from two German grammar schools. Students completed three bionics-focused modules— “polar bear”, “heat transfer”, and “temperature and heat”—integrated into science lessons. Data from questionnaires and performance tests assessed prior knowledge, learning success, cognitive activation, and situational interest. Results: The findings indicate that 98% of students found digital media motivating, with 81% favoring a hybrid mix of traditional and digital teaching methods. Positive emotional responses were reported by 62% of participants, though 38% experienced uncertainty. The “polar bear” module achieved the highest learning gain (+41%), followed by “heat transfer” (+23%) and “temperature and heat” (+13%) module. Discussion: These results suggest that adaptive digital learning platforms can enhance learning outcomes and cognitive engagement, particularly when the content aligns with student interests and needs.

AB  - Dialogue-based tutoring platforms have shown great promise in helping individual students improve mastery. Short answer grading is a crucial component of such platforms. However, generative short answer grading using the same platform for diverse disciplines and titles is a crucial challenge due to data distribution variations across domains and a frequent occurrence of non-sentential answers. Recent NLP research has introduced novel deep learning architectures such as the Transformer, which merely uses self-attention mechanisms. Pre-trained models based on the Transformer architecture have been used to produce impressive results across a range of NLP tasks. In this work, we experiment with fine-tuning a pre-trained self-attention language model, namely Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) applying it to short answer grading, and show that it produces superior results across multiple domains. On the benchmarking dataset of SemEval-2013, we report upÂ to 10% absolute improvement in macro-average-F1 over state-of-the-art results. On our two psychology domain datasets, the fine-tuned model yields classification almost upÂ to the human-agreement levels. Moreover, we study the effectiveness of fine-tuning as a function of the size of the task-specific labeled data, the number of training epochs, and its generalizability to cross-domain and join-domain scenarios.

AB  - The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators have significant concerns about students misusing LLMs or LLMs misleading students with inaccurate answers. This paper introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist leverages retrieval-augmented generation along with user intent classification and post-processing to ensure that responses align with specific course learning goals, thereby addressing the pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. I evaluate CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT 3.5 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. This work not only highlights the importance of deliberate design considerations in LLM-based educational tools but also opens up avenues for future research, particularly in understanding user interactions with such systems in real-world scenarios and integrating human educators into LLM-based tutoring systems.

AB  - Introduction and aim The surging incidence of type 2 diabetes has become a growing concern for the healthcare sector. This chronic ailment, characterized by its complex blend of genetic and lifestyle determinants, has witnessed a notable increase in recent times, exerting substantial pressure on healthcare resources. As more individuals turn to online platforms for health guidance and embrace the utilization of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT; San Francisco, CA: OpenAI), a text-generating AI (TGAI), to get insights into their well-being, evaluating its effectiveness and reliability becomes crucial. This research primarily aimed to evaluate the correctness of TGAI responses to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inquiries via ChatGPT. Furthermore, this study aimed to examine the consistency of TGAI in addressing common queries on T2DM complications for patient education. Material and methods Questions on T2DM were formulated by experienced physicians and screened by research personnel before querying ChatGPT. Each question was posed thrice, and the collected answers were summarized. Responses were then sorted into three distinct categories as follows: (a) appropriate, (b) inappropriate, and (c) unreliable by two seasoned physicians. In instances of differing opinions, a third physician was consulted to achieve consensus. Results From the initial set of 110 T2DM questions, 40 were dismissed by experts for relevance, resulting in a final count of 70. An overwhelming 98.5% of the AI's answers were judged as appropriate, thus underscoring its reliability over traditional online search engines. Nonetheless, a 1.5% rate of inappropriate responses underlines the importance of ongoing AI improvements and strict adherence to medical protocols. Conclusion TGAI provides medical information of high quality and reliability. This study underscores TGAI's impressive effectiveness in delivering reliable information about T2DM, with 98.5% of responses aligning with the standard of care. These results hold promise for integrating AI platforms as supplementary tools to enhance patient education and outcomes.

AB  - Bringing artificial intelligence (AI) and living intelligence into higher education has the potential to completely reshape teaching, learning, and administrative processes. Living intelligence is not just about using AI—it is about creating a dynamic partnership between human thinking and AI capabilities. This collaboration allows for continuous adaptation, co-evolution, and real-time learning, making education more responsive to individual student needs and evolving academic environments. AI-driven tools are already enhancing the way students learn by personalizing content, streamlining processes, and introducing innovative teaching methods. Adaptive platforms adjust material based on individual progress, while emotionally intelligent AI systems help support students’ mental well-being by detecting and responding to emotional cues. These advancements also make education more inclusive, helping to bridge accessibility gaps for underserved communities. However, while AI has the potential to improve education significantly, it also introduces challenges, such as ethical concerns, data privacy risks, and algorithmic bias. The real challenge is not just about embracing AI’s benefits but ensuring it is used responsibly, fairly, and in a way that aligns with educational values. From a sustainability perspective, living intelligence supports efficiency, equity, and resilience within educational institutions. AI-driven solutions can help optimize energy use, predict maintenance needs, and reduce waste, all contributing to a smaller environmental footprint. At the same time, adaptive learning systems help minimize resource waste by tailoring education to individual progress, while AI-powered curriculum updates keep programs relevant in a fast-changing world. This paper explores the disconnect between AI’s promise and the real-world difficulties of implementing it responsibly in higher education. While AI and living intelligence have the potential to revolutionize the learning experience, their adoption is often slowed by ethical concerns, regulatory challenges, and the need for institutions to adapt. Addressing these issues requires clear policies, faculty training, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By examining both the benefits and challenges of AI in education, this paper focuses on how institutions can integrate AI in a responsible and sustainable way. The goal is to encourage collaboration between technologists, educators, and policymakers to fully harness AI’s potential while ensuring that it enhances learning experiences, upholds ethical standards, and creates an inclusive, future-ready educational environment.

AB  - Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant and popular form of NAI, presents a promising avenue for advancing personalized instruction via neurosymbolic educational agents. By leveraging structured knowledge, these agents can provide individualized learning experiences that align with specific learner preferences and desired learning paths, while also mitigating biases inherent in traditional AI systems. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of KGs, LLMs, and pedagogical agents – embodied characters designed to enhance learning – as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.

AB  - Purpose: In 2022 generative AI took the Internet world by storm. Free access to tools that can generate text and images that pass for human creations triggered fiery debates about the potential uses and misuses of generative AI in education. There has risen a need to check the popular utopian and dystopian narratives about AI against the diversity of hopes, concerns and future imaginaries that educators themselves associate with generative AI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perspectives of Finnish teacher educators on the use of AI in education. Design/methodology/approach: This article reports findings from a hands-on workshop in teacher training, where participants learned about how generative AI works, collaboratively explored generative AI and then reflected on its potential and challenges. Findings: The results reveal nuanced, calm and thoughtful imaginaries rooted in deep understanding of educational policy, evaluation and the sociocultural context of education. The results cover teachers’ views on the impact of AI on learners’ agency, metacognition, self-regulation and more. Originality/value: This article offers a unique exploration into the perceptions and imaginaries of educators regarding generative AI in specific (instead of “monolithic AI”), moving beyond dystopian views and instead focusing on the potential of AI to align with existing pedagogical practices. The educators contrasted the common techno-deterministic narratives and perceived AI as an avenue to support formative assessment practices and development of metacognition, self-regulation, responsibility and well-being. The novel insights also include the need for AI education that critically incorporates social and ethical viewpoints and fosters visions for a future with culturally, socially and environmentally sustainable AI.

AB  - While automatic dialogue tutors hold great potential in making education personalized and more accessible, research on such systems has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently large and high-quality datasets. Collecting such datasets remains challenging, as recording tutoring sessions raises privacy concerns and crowdsourcing leads to insufficient data quality. To address this, we propose a framework to generate such dialogues by pairing human teachers with a Large Language Model (LLM) prompted to represent common student errors. We describe how we use this framework to collect MathDial, a dataset of 3k one-to-one teacher-student tutoring dialogues grounded in multi-step math reasoning problems. While models like GPT-3 are good problem solvers, they fail at tutoring because they generate factually incorrect feedback or are prone to revealing solutions to students too early. To overcome this, we let teachers provide learning opportunities to students by guiding them using various scaffolding questions according to a taxonomy of teacher moves. We demonstrate MathDial and its extensive annotations can be used to finetune models to be more effective tutors (and not just solvers). We confirm this by automatic and human evaluation, notably in an interactive setting that measures the trade-off between student solving success and telling solutions. The dataset is released publicly.

AB  - ChatGPT, a generative AI program developed by OpenAI, has raised serious questions about the future of education since its launch in November 2022. This paper argues that ChatGPT has the potential to redefine existing educational theories and the role of teachers in language education. Specifically, the paper examines ChatGPT’s impact on language education and suggests ways to incorporate it into teaching practice. Since people have been proclaiming that AI would replace teachers since the 1970s, the history of AI in education is relevant to this paper. Therefore, the paper first discusses the history of AI in education to provide context and highlight how ChatGPT fits into this larger conversation. Afterwards, the paper then explores how ChatGPT might redefine existing learning theories such as Constructivism and Self-Determination Theory using the AIED framework. ChatGPT has the potential to provide learners with personalized and adaptive learning experiences that align with these learning theories. For this reason, the paper will investigate how ChatGPT may impact the role of learners through the lens of Learner Autonomy before looking at how it might also redefine the role of the teacher in the classrooms of the near future. While ChatGPT has the potential to automate certain aspects of language education, the role of the teacher as a mentor and guide in the learning process is still essential. Finally, the paper offers suggestions for how educators can effectively incorporate generative AI programs like ChatGPT into their teaching practice and curriculum. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of approaching the integration of AI in education with caution and a critical perspective.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) has the potential to transform educational practice, and its media representation both reflects and reshapes public perceptions of this new technology. While interest in AIEd is growing worldwide, not all social actors are represented equally. Moreover, limited media coverage contributes to a scarcity of studies on AIEd media representations. This study examines how social actors are represented in AIEd discourses in China Daily (2018–2023), using 100 news articles selected through stratified proportional sampling in Nexis Uni to ensure balanced coverage across all years. Employing intertextuality analysis and social actor theory, the results show that government and corporate voices dominate, while public perspectives are marginalized. Discursive strategies, including objectivation, functionalization, and activation, construct a hierarchical collaboration, where government actors are activated to emphasize leadership, and corporate actors are functionalized as enabler to state-defined goals. Intertextuality analysis highlights co-occurrence between corporate and parental discourses, which risks prioritizing commercial interests over educational equity. This alignment weakened after 2021, reflecting a shift in government efforts to regulate educational commercialization. These findings show a hierarchical power dynamic in AIEd discourses, where government actors dominate and corporate actors subordinate, while public voices are marginalized. This framing prioritizes the institutional corporate and state interests, and limits inclusivity and diversity. This study advances the understanding of AIEd media discourses in a context distinct from Western-centric perspectives. By unpacking the imbalanced representations of social actors, this study uncovers the underlying power dynamics and ideologies in AIEd discourse. It encourages policymakers, educators, and media professionals to address equity and inclusion in media representations.

AB  - AI-enhanced adaptive learning systems, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), improve teaching methods and enhance learning experiences across various domains, especially in technical subjects like mathematics and sciences. They provide personalized and adaptable environments, fostering engagement and academic achievement through tailored educational approaches. Despite the significant advancements in mathematical language processing driven by the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning these expansive models for specialized mathematical tasks poses notable challenges. This is often a consequence of the scarcity of labeled datasets in this domain. To bridge this gap, this study curates a unique dataset, comprising around 4,000 formulas from mathematics, physics, and engineering, which features computationally rearranged equations paired with expert-reviewed, student-friendly explanations. Developed using the SymPy Python library, it serves as a comprehensive resource for evaluating language models in mathematical education. Furthermore, utilizing both the mathematical LaTeX and the string format of equations, this research fine-tunes several LLMs to highlight the differences between the models’ explanation generation capabilities and performance in generating accurate and informative mathematical explanations. Additionally, the comparison between outputs generated using LaTeX and string representations offers insights into the effectiveness of each format in conveying mathematical semantics. This research study contributes to the field of automated mathematics education, providing a deeper understanding of the potential of language models in creating explanations for intelligent tutoring systems. Our key achievements include the tbs17/MathBERT-custom model's enhanced Rouge-1 score, which marginally increased from 0.9678 in LaTeX format to 0.9679 in string format. More notably, the AnReu_math_pretrained_bert model's Rouge-1 score significantly improved from 0.9116 when using LaTeX to 0.9479 with string representations. This underscores the superior handling of string formats by these models, leading to improved explanation generation in the field of mathematics.

AB  - Writing assessment is one of the most important stages in the educational process, but it is also the most resource-demanding one. To address the challenges of scalability and inconsistency, this study proposes a Transformer-LSTM model for automated scoring and feedback generation, enhancing accuracy and reliability in assessment. Integrating the contextual reading abilities of transformers with the sequential analysis strength of LSTMs, the model analyzes significant metrics of writing quality, including grammar, coherence, and structure, while providing individualized, actionable feedback. Using annotated datasets and evaluation metrics like RMSE and feedback relevance, it was established that the model performs well overall and that improvements in grammar and coherence seemed to be the most significant contributors to writing ability. It was also demonstrated that feedback relevance enhances these outcomes, thus confirming its valuable role in promoting structural and grammatical accuracy. Understanding that most existing systems do not encourage significant human feedback, this work demonstrates a scalable approach with potential alignment with human evaluation standards. Finally, this study shows hybrid models’ promise for automated writing assessment as promising scalable, equitable, impact-based tools for global enhancement of educational outcomes.

AB  - Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven text-to-speech (TTS) technology have enabled transformative applications in accessibility and personalized learning. This study focuses on the development of a customizable Turkish TTS system aimed at enhancing lecture notes through personalized narration. Despite significant progress in widely spoken languages, the study addresses the lack of open-source Turkish TTS solutions by leveraging Narakeet TTS and fine-tuning the RVCv2 model. The methodology involves processing user-recorded voice data, segmenting audio, and training a voice conversion model to align synthesized TTS output with the speaker’s unique vocal characteristics. Metrics such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD), Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), and Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) were employed to evaluate system performance. In order to determine the similarity of the produced voice to the user’s voice, the first sound and the last sound were compared with the Emphasized Channel Attention, Propagation, and Aggregation Time Delay Neural Network (ECAPA-TDNN). Results demonstrate that the personalized model achieves high intelligibility and similarity to the original voice, with MCD values 0, PESQ scores 4.5, STOI scores 1, and ECAPA-TDNN similarity 0.62. This study underscores the potential of open-source TTS solutions in supporting less-resourced languages and highlights the importance of personalization in educational AI tools.

LA  - eng
JF  - Arxiv
PY  - 2023
AB  - Although automatic dialogue tutors hold great potential in making education personalized and more accessible, research on such systems has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently large and high-quality datasets. However, collecting such datasets remains challenging, as recording tutoring sessions raises privacy concerns and crowdsourcing leads to insufficient data quality. To address this problem, we propose a framework to semi-synthetically generate such dialogues by pairing real teachers with a large language model (LLM) scaffolded to represent common student errors. In this paper, we describe our ongoing efforts to use this framework to collect MathDial, a dataset of currently ca. 1.5k tutoring dialogues grounded in multi-step math word problems. We show that our dataset exhibits rich pedagogical properties, focusing on guiding students using sense-making questions to let them explore problems. Moreover, we outline that MathDial and its grounding annotations can be used to finetune language models to be more effective tutors (and not just solvers) and highlight remaining challenges that need to be addressed by the research community. We will release our dataset publicly to foster research in this socially important area of NLP.

AB  - At the forefront of industries profoundly influenced by artificial intelligence (AI), public relations (PRs) are undergoing a transformative revolution. The increasing applications of AI in PRs are driving a demand for proficient practitioners. Recognizing this, PR educational institutions must adapt by delivering tailored AI education. Despite the growing importance of AI, a literature review reveals a lack of a well-designed AI curriculum in PRs. This essay draws insights from recent research on AI value alignment, dialogic communication, and PR ethics, articulating three foundational principles for AI education in PR: authentic dialogue, client value centricity, and legal and ethical considerations. Aligned with these principles, the essay outlines four essential knowledge areas for PR AI education: programming and coding proficiency, AI fundamentals, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system, and the LangChain framework for information security, as well as AI deployment and model optimization. An illustrative syllabus is presented to solidify these concepts. The essay further explores potential future directions and implications of integrating AI into PR education.

AB  - AI models have shown a remarkable ability to perform representation learning using large-scale data. In particular, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) attests to the capability of AI models to learn complex hidden structures in a bottom-up manner without requiring a lot of human expertise. In this paper, we leverage these models to learn Math learning strategies at scale. Specifically, we use student interaction data from the MATHia Intelligent Tutoring System to learn strategies based on sequences of actions performed by students. To do this, we develop an AI model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers) that has two main components. First, we pre-train BERT using an approach known as Masked Language Modeling to learn embeddings for strategies. The embeddings represent strategies in a vector form while preserving their semantics. Next, we fine-tune the model to predict if students are likely to apply a correct strategy to solve a novel problem. We demonstrate using a large dataset collected from 655 schools that our approach where we pre-train to learn strategies from a sample of schools can be fine-tuned with a small number of examples to make accurate predictions over student data collected from other schools.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into computer science (CS) education is evolving, yet its specific application in database instruction remains underexplored. This systematic review analyzes 31 empirical studies published between 2020 and 2025, examining how AI applications support teaching and learning in CS, with an emphasis on database education. Following the PRISMA methodology, the review categorizes AI applications according to instructional design models, roles, actions, benefits, and challenges. Findings indicate that AI tools, particularly chatbots, intelligent tutoring systems, and code generators, effectively support personalized instruction, immediate feedback, and interactive problem-solving across CS and database-specific contexts. However, challenges persist, including AI inaccuracies, biases, student dependency in AI, and academic integrity risks. The review also identifies a shift in programming education as AI reshapes software development practices, prompting a need to align curricula with evolving industry expectations. Despite growing attention to AI applications in programming education, database-related research remains limited. This review highlights the necessity for further empirical investigations specifically in database instruction, including more extensive studies addressing AI-driven pedagogical strategies and their long-term impacts. The results suggest that careful integration of AI tools can complement traditional instruction, emphasizing the critical role of human educators in achieving meaningful and effective learning outcomes.

AB  - Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student’s error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4’s annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

AB  - The development of technology has marked great changes in all areas, especially in education, the incorporation of various tools supported by artificial intelligence has brought positive and negative consequences, in many cases there is a lack of knowledge of these and therefore they have not been properly used. This study attempts to evaluate and compare some generative language tools through a literature search and their practical use. Using content analysis, the seven selected tools were compared considering the criteria of: Efficiency, Quality, Usability, Scalability and Costs. The results show that tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Whisper, Hugging Face and Grammarly stand out for their high efficiency, quality, usability and scalability, being the most robust options for various educational applications. While tools such as Google Bard and Khan Academy's AI Tutor offer good evaluations in usability and scalability, with relatively low costs, making them accessible and effective in educational environments. Some limitations were identified in tools such as Talk to Books and ChatPDF that present challenges in efficiency and usability, limiting their applicability compared to more advanced tools. In addition, GPT for Slides, although functional for presentations, shows limitations in scalability and security. It was identified that there is a positive correlation between efficiency and quality in most tools, although there are exceptions where these aspects are not aligned. It is concluded that generative tools in Higher Education are crucial to modernize teaching and are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Choosing the right tool should consider factors such as security, costs and ease of use to maximize its educational impact.

AB  - This research full paper describes a web-based online learning platform that delivers financial literacy lessons via talking head videos of AI-generated personas with two additional core features: LLM-powered proactive chat-based question-and-answer interactivity, and personal choice of the AI instructor from a list of distinct personas. We conducted two comparative studies with a total of 233 Thai students aged 1825, which aim to 1) investigate the impact of interactivity and instructor selection on the learning experience, and 2) further explore the underlying factors at play with instructor selection by introducing AI instructors' backstories as an extra intervention. We found that enabling interactivity significantly enhanced learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and virtual instructors' humanness compared to the passive setting. Providing learners with a choice of AI instructors provided minimal additional benefit. However, the learner's feeling of relatedness toward the instructor is a significant positive predictor of learning motivation, positive emotion, and agent credibility, while goal alignment with the agent correlates with perceived learning facilitation, and admiration corresponds with perceived agent humanness. These findings underscore the potential of interactive virtual instructors-ones that interactively encourage learners to reflect on the teaching materials throughout the lesson through two-way interaction-in enhancing motivational and experiential aspects of remote education, even if they do not significantly impact comprehension, and the importance of promoting learner's relatedness and goal alignment with the agent in boosting other aspects of the learning experience.

AB  - The rapid evolution of educational technology (EdTech) has transformed learning environments, offering unprecedented opportunities for personalized, adaptive, and immersive education. Despite the increasing adoption of these innovations, the EdTech field lacks comprehensive, data-driven analyses to systematically categorize proprietary technologies and assess their developmental trajectories. Addressing this gap, this study employs a dataset of 85,267 patents to map the technological landscape of EdTech through patent mining, clustering, and technology life cycle analysis. Using natural language processing and clustering techniques, 15 distinct technology clusters were identified, including Learning Management Systems, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Adaptive Learning Systems, and Educational Robotics. Each cluster was further analyzed using logistic regression to determine its stage within the technology life cycle—emerging, growth, maturity, or saturation. Key findings indicate that Interactive Display Technologies have reached saturation, while Adaptive Learning Systems and Virtual and Augmented Reality are in active growth, highlighting their transformative potential for future innovations. The study also integrates the SAMR model to evaluate how these technologies align with pedagogical goals, distinguishing between those that enhance existing practices and those that redefine educational experiences.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) can transfer their reasoning skills to smaller models by teaching them to generate the intermediate reasoning process required to solve multistep reasoning tasks. While LLMs can accurately solve reasoning tasks through a variety of strategies, even without fine-tuning, smaller models are not expressive enough to fit the LLMs distribution on all strategies when distilled and tend to prioritize one strategy over the others. This reliance on one strategy poses a challenge for smaller models when attempting to solve reasoning tasks that may be difficult with their preferred strategy. To address this, we propose a distillation method SIKeD (Self-guided Iterative Knowledge Distillation for mathematical reasoning), where the LLM teaches the smaller model to approach a task using different strategies and the smaller model uses its self-generated on-policy outputs to choose the most suitable strategy for the given task. The training continues in a self-guided iterative manner, where for each training iteration, a decision is made on how to combine the LLM data with the self-generated outputs. Unlike traditional distillation methods, SIKeD allows the smaller model to learn which strategy is suitable for a given task while continuously learning to solve a task using different strategies. Our experiments on various mathematical reasoning datasets show that SIKeD significantly outperforms traditional distillation techniques across smaller models of different sizes.

AB  - In this study, we introduce a Conversational Intelligent Tutoring System designed to create an interactive and immersive learning experience aimed at improving the speaking abilities of second language learners. This system mimics a human tutor by engaging in role-play dialogues with the learner, based on predefined scenarios, and offers corrective feedback on the learners’ utterance, while also engaging in chat to encourage student participation. The tutoring system includes a deep-learning classifier to assess students’ utterances, a dialogue generator customized for responding to students’ free-form chats, and a straightforward dialogue manager to determine the sequence of conversational turns. To tackle the challenge posed by the scarcity of tutoring dialogue resources, a significant hurdle for deep learning methods, we present a cost-effective approach that efficiently extends existing Korean dialogue datasets for the purpose of intelligent language tutoring. We carried out a series of experiments to compare various fine-tuned models based on language models of different sizes, and included a comparative analysis with ChatGPT. We discovered that smaller, specialized, fine-tuned models can either surpass or match the performance of GPT-4 in specific tutoring applications. Given the educational sector’s demand for cost-effective solutions, our contributions, spanning system design, dataset development, and comparative analysis, serve as valuable references to address these needs.

AB  - This document describes a solution to a problem in the automatic content scoring of the multilingual character-by-character highlighting item type. This solution is language independent and represents a significant enhancement. This solution not only facilitates automatic scoring but plays an important role in clustering students' responses; consequently, it has a nontrivial impact on the refinement of the items and/or their scoring guidelines. Furthermore, though designed for a specific problem, the proposed solution is general enough for any educational task that can be transformed into a sequential one. To name a few: It can be used for a set of actions expected from a student in simulations or learning trajectories as projected by a teacher, inside an intelligent tutoring system, or even in a game—or it can simply be used for a set of student clicks, button selections, or keyboard hits expected to reach a correct answer. This solution provides flexibility for existing automatic-scoring techniques and potentially could provide more flexibility if coupled with statistical data-mining techniques.

AB  - Open-domain factoid question-answering (ODFQA) aims to answer questions posed in natural language by retrieving and extracting relevant information from large, unstructured text sources. A range of applications have benefited from ODFQA including improved search relevancy in search engines and information retrieval, enable semantic searches, interactive and personalized learning systems, and the creation of large language models. Although significant research on ODFQA for English and other languages has been done, Urdu-specific research in this area remains limited. This is due to the lack of high-quality datasets and the challenges associated with processing Urdu text. To address the unavailability of Urdu-specific resources for the ODFQA task, we developed a benchmark corpus, comprising 3,985 Urdu questions and corresponding Urdu Wikipedia articles, with 1,006 answerable and 2,979 unanswerable questions. Each question in our proposed corpus was manually annotated by three independent annotators. As a secondary contribution, we carried out extensive experimentation using a range of state- of-the-art models, including retrievers (BM25 and Sentence-BERT), multilingual transformers (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa-Large, XLM-RoBERTa-Large-Squad2), and large language models (GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18) on our proposed corpus. Best results were obtained using the XLM-RoBERTa-Large-Squad2 model with F1 = 0.61 and EM = 0.41@k = 20. While the finetuned GPT-4o-mini model was the best model, with F1 = 0.81 and EM = 0.81@k=1.

AB  - Question generation for educational assessments is an expanding field within artificial intelligence, particularly in educational technology domains such as intelligent tutoring systems and dialogue-based platforms. These tools are crucial for creating assessment questions with clear-cut answers, typically relying on syntactical and semantic cues within declarative sentences to transform them into questions. Recent efforts have focused on generating educational questions in Arabic, but performance has been hindered by issues like sentence parsing inaccuracies, named entity recognition problems, and errors from rule-based question transformation, exacerbated by the complexity of lengthy Arabic sentences. This research introduces an innovative Arabic question-generation system built on a three-stage process: extraction of keywords and key phrases, question generation, and subsequent ranking. The proposed framework leverages an existing pre-trained model without fine-tuning, achieving results comparable to fine-tuned models. Notably, it achieved impressive metrics with a BLEU score of 17.31, ROUGE-L of 51.6, and METEOR of 32.74. These results underscore the framework’s effectiveness and potential in generating high-quality assessment questions in Arabic. Human evaluation further validated the model’s performance, highlighting its significant contribution to the field of automatic question generation for educational assessments.

AB  - Handwriting Mathematical Expression Recognition has several applications, including the potential to make Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) more accessible to underserved regions. However, young children’s handwriting pose several challenges, even for instructors, calling for advanced approaches to understand their writings. This paper explores the potential of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLM) for recognizing numbers or mathematical expressions handwritten by children by comparing GPT-4V, LLaVA 1.5, and CogVLM on a dataset of 251 images. Results indicate that while pre-trained models offer promise, their performance without fine-tuning or zero-shot learning remains inadequate. Results reveal the challenges of utilizing pre-trained VLMs for recognizing children’s handwriting, particularly in educational settings. Issues such as poor handwriting and partial erasures pose difficulties for existing models, with GPT-4V’s safety system limitations hindering its efficacy. In general, CogVLM presented the best performance. GPT-4V exhibited superior performance in recognizing equations, but still struggles with handwritten content, highlighting the need for model refinement and data policies. This study contributes insights into the potential of existing pre-trained models in educational contexts and demonstrates the importance of, for example, fine-tuning to domain-specific datasets. Continued research is necessary to enhance VLM capabilities for educational support, particularly in children’s handwriting recognition.

AB  - Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. This will enable a level of personalization in learning systems that to date has been largely unattainable at scale, providing finely tailored curricula that adapt to an individual's learning pace and accessibility needs, including the diagnosis of student understanding of subjects at a fine-grained level, identifying gaps in foundational knowledge, and adjusting instruction accordingly. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of pedagogical agents -- embodied characters designed to enhance learning -- as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. To do so, these agents can thus simulate nuanced discussions, debates, and problem-solving exercises that push learners beyond rote memorization toward deep comprehension. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.

AB  - This study examines Q-Chat, a new tool developed by Quizlet that integrates ChatGPT API, for its potential for L2 vocabulary learning. As a generative AI tool, ChatGPT has shown significant potential in enhancing language learning through interactive conversations, grammar corrections, and personalized learning experiences. However, challenges such as the learning optimization gap and the knowledge comprehension gap have been identified by previous research, affecting beginners’ ability to fully utilize these technologies for language learning. Q-Chat, as an Intelligent Tutoring System enhanced by OpenAI’s ChatGPT API, addresses the gaps by offering structured, scaffolded learning experiences that adapt to various learning styles and skill levels. The paper introduces the design principles of Q-chat, detailing how this tool leverages AI-empowered conversational interface to engage and guide learners in a more structured manner of learning. The paper highlights the importance of aligning design of AI-enhanced learning products with pedagogical and learning needs, and the importance of training language educators in understanding AI concepts to ensure meaningful integration of AI in teaching. It calls for future empirical studies to explore the practical implementation of ITSs in L2 classrooms and their impact on students’ learning process.

AB  - As textbooks evolve into digital platforms, they open a world of opportunities for Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research. This paper delves into the novel use of textbooks as a source of high-quality labeled data for automatic keyword extraction, demonstrating an affordable and efficient alternative to traditional methods. By utilizing the wealth of structured information provided in textbooks, we propose a methodology for annotating corpora across diverse domains, circumventing the costly and time-consuming process of manual data annotation. Our research presents a deep learning model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) fine-tuned on this newly labeled dataset. This model is applied to keyword extraction tasks, with the model’s performance surpassing established baselines. We further analyze the transformation of BERT’s embedding space before and after the fine-tuning phase, illuminating how the model adapts to specific domain goals. Our findings substantiate textbooks as a resource-rich, untapped well of high-quality labeled data, underpinning their significant role in the AIED research landscape.

DO  - 10.48550/arXiv.2310.10648
AB  - Scaling high-quality tutoring is a major challenge in education. Because of the growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike professional educators, struggle to effectively address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities for students. In this paper, we explore the potential for large language models (LLMs) to assist math tutors in remediating student mistakes. We present ReMath, a benchmark co-developed with experienced math teachers that deconstructs their thought process for remediation. The benchmark consists of three step-by-step tasks: (1) infer the type of student error, (2) determine the strategy to address the error, and (3) generate a response that incorporates that information. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art instruct-tuned and dialog models on ReMath. Our findings suggest that although models consistently improve upon original tutor responses, we cannot rely on models alone to remediate mistakes. Providing models with the error type (e.g., the student is guessing) and strategy (e.g., simplify the problem) leads to a 75

AB  - The idea of building intelligent machines has been around for centuries, with a new wave of promising artificial intelligence (AI) in the twenty-first century. Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) is a younger phenomenon that has created hype and promises, but also been seen as a threat by critical voices. There have been rich discussions on over-optimism and hype in contemporary AI research. Less has been written about the hyped expectations on AIED and its potential to transform current education. There is huge potential for efficiency and cost reduction, but there is also aspects of quality education and the teacher role. The aim of the study is to identify potential aspects of threat, hype and promise in artificial intelligence for education. A scoping literature review was conducted to gather relevant state-of-the art research in the field of AIED. Main keywords used in the literature search were: artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence in education, AI, AIED, teacher perspective, education, and teacher. Data were analysed with the SWOT-framework as theoretical lens for a thematic analysis. The study identifies a wide variety of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for artificial intelligence in education. Findings suggest that there are several important questions to discuss and address in future research, such as: What should the role of the teacher be in education with AI? How does AI align with pedagogical goals and beliefs? And how to handle the potential leak and misuse of user data when AIED systems are developed by for-profit organisations?

PB  - ProQuest Dissertations & Theses
AB  - Developing models, using mathematics, and constructing explanations are three practices essential for science inquiry learning according to education reform efforts, such as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). However, students struggle with these intersecting practices, especially when developing and interpreting mathematical models (i.e., graphs and corresponding equations) of scientific phenomena and writing explanations that connect the mathematical representations to their scientific meaning. As such, students require targeted support to address their difficulties while they are working in science inquiry contexts. Thus, recent work with the Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System (Inq-ITS) virtual lab environment focuses on the design and development of performance-based formative assessments with the goal of automatically assessing and supporting students on fine-grained components underlying mathematical modeling as well as exploring novel techniques for assessing explanation writing. The studies presented in this dissertation were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the automated scaffolds in the Inq-ITS environment and examine how large language models could be leveraged to assess students' written explanations about their mathematical models in a way that provides formative data to teachers to guide their instruction. These findings inform how innovative technologies, such as virtual inquiry environments, can be used to assess and support NGSS-aligned mathematical modeling and explanation writing competencies in science inquiry contexts, thus preparing students for future success in mathematics and science.

AB  - The potential of AI technology to transform human life, well-being, and daily work is faced with numerous risks and challenges yet to be fully accounted for. However, the complexity of AI ethics makes it hard to pin down what to teach, how to teach it, and how to assess its effectiveness. Drawing on an educational perspective, this paper presents a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of the early years of AI ethics education as a formalized field to analyze whether its future trajectory is aligned with educational best practices. Our review highlights core challenges in AI ethics education and the content, assessment, and pedagogy used in real interventions over recent years. We find that efforts to teach AI ethics do helpfully draw on a holistic view (as opposed to a narrow view), and utilize progressive pedagogies like case studies and group projects that aim to meaningfully challenge students’ ethical reasoning skills in applied practices. However, many real- world AI ethics teaching interventions do not leverage well-supported assessment techniques known to support student learning; rather, assessment is conducted primarily for research evaluative purposes. This gap in rigorous assessment raises implications for researchers and practitioners, as responsible development and use of AI will be stymied if educators cannot successfully determine whether students have truly learned relevant AI ethics content or skills.

AB  - Current evaluation schemes for large language models often fail to consider the impact of the overlap between pretraining corpus and test data on model performance statistics. Snoopy is an online interface that allows researchers to study this impact in few-shot learning settings. Our demo provides term frequency statistics for the Pile, which is an 800GB corpus, accompanied by the precomputed performance of EleutherAI/GPT models on more than 20 NLP benchmarks, including numerical, commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding, and question-answering tasks. Snoopy allows a user to interactively align specific terms in test instances with their frequency in the Pile, enabling exploratory analysis of how term frequency is related to the accuracy of the models, which are hard to discover through automated means. A user can look at correlations over various model sizes and numbers of in-context examples and visualize the result across multiple (potentially aggregated) datasets. Using Snoopy, we show that a researcher can quickly replicate prior analyses for numerical tasks, while simultaneously allowing for much more expansive exploration that was previously challenging. Snoopy is available at https://nlp.ics.uci.edu/snoopy.

AB  - Automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) is a key component of intelligent tutoring systems. Deep learning is an advanced method to deal with recognizing textual entailment tasks in an end-to-end manner. However, deep learning methods for ASAG still remain challenging mainly because of the following two major reasons: 1) high-precision scoring requires a deep understanding of the answer text; and 2) ASAG's corpus is usually small and cannot provide enough training data for deep learning. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel bidirectional encoder representation from transformer (BERT)-based deep neural network framework for ASAG. First, we use a pretrained and fine-tuned BERT model to dynamically encode the answer text, which can effectively overcome the problem of a too small corpus in the ASAG task. Second, to generate a powerful semantic representation for ASAG, we construct a semantic refinement layer to refine the semantics of the BERT outputs, which consists of a bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Capsule network with position information in parallel. Third, we propose a triple-hot loss strategy for regression tasks in ASAG, which changes the gold label representation in the standard cross-entropy loss function from one-hot to triple-hot. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is effective and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems on both the SemEval-2013 dataset and the Mohler dataset. The code is available online at https://github.com/wuhan-1222/ASAG.

This paper delves into the complexities of AI's role in Education, addressing the mixed messages that have both enthused and alarmed educators, policymakers, and the public. It explores the promises that AI holds for enhancing learning through personalisation at scale, against the backdrop of concerns about ethical implications, the devaluation of non-STEM subjects, and the potential transformative impact on our neurocognitive and socio-emotional functioning. Drawing on recent research and global discourse, the paper seeks to unpack the reasons behind the vagueness of current discussions on AI in Education (AIED) and the implications of this ambiguity for future educational practices and policies. By highlighting insights from educational research and synthesising evidence-based best practices in AIED, the aim is to provide a clearer understanding of how AI technologies can be aligned with the fundamental principles of learning and teaching, and explore what concrete actions may need to be prioritised now to truly enhance learning experiences and outcomes for all in the future.

AB  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) possess significant potential to enhance learning outcomes. However, deploying ITSs in global south countries presents challenges due to their frequent lack of essential technological resources, such as computers and internet access. The concept of AIED Unplugged has emerged to bridge this digital divide, supporting the creation of theoretical frameworks for developing ITS unplugged. Nevertheless, prior research has not evaluated ITS unplugged with teachers, diminishing the importance of aligning technological solutions with their target users’ practical requirements and viewpoints. This article addresses this gap by presenting the design and evaluation of an ITS unplugged for numeracy education. Through face-to-face usability tests and interviews with Brazilian primary education teachers, the study employs thematic analysis to understand teachers’ perceptions profoundly. Results reveal that teachers value ITS unplugged for optimizing lesson planning, offering real-time error-specific feedback, providing learning analytics, and enabling personalized group learning within classrooms. Additionally, concerns about application size and internet dependency underscore important considerations for underserved regions. Such empirical evidence on teachers’ perceptions bridges the gap between theoretical frameworks and real-world user perspectives, demonstrating that ITS unplugged can address educational disparities, provided it aligns with teachers’ needs, technological limitations, and contextual factors. As educational technology evolves, comprehending the viewpoints of primary users becomes pivotal for equitable implementation. Therefore, this article represents a significant stride toward deploying AIED in the global south and other underserved regions. By combining theoretical concepts with practical user insights, ITS unplugged can be a transformative solution for education.

AB  - Knowledge tracing (KT) is essential in intelligent tutoring systems for tracking learners' knowledge states and predicting their future performance. Numerous prevailing KT methods prioritize modeling learners' behavioral patterns in acquiring knowledge and the relationship among interactions. However, due to the sparsity problem, they frequently encounter challenges in effectively uncovering latent contextual features embedded within the learning sequences. This limitation may impose certain constraints on the predictive performance. In light of this concern, this article focuses on extracting latent features from learning sequences to enhance the assessment of knowledge states. Consequently, we design optimized pretraining mechanisms and introduce an enhanced deep KT method, optimized pretraining deep KT (OPKT). In the pretraining phase, the self-supervised learning approach is effectively employed to train comprehensive contextual encodings of the learning sequences. During fine-tuning, the contextual encodings are transferred to the downstream KT model, which then generates the knowledge states and makes predictions. Through our experiments, the superiority of our method over six existing KT models on five publicly available datasets is demonstrated. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies and visualized analysis validate the rationality and effectiveness of every component of the OPKT architecture.

AB  - The Learning Assistant Manager and Builder (LAMB) is an open-source software framework that lets educators build and deploy AI learning assistants within institutional Learning Management Systems (LMS) without coding expertise. It addresses critical challenges in educational AI by providing privacy-focused integration, controlled knowledge bases, and seamless deployment through standard protocols. This paper presents major enhancements that enable systematic quality assurance and continuous improvement of these learning assistants. The new LAMB includes mechanisms for structured feedback on real-world assistant behavior, transforming it into a test suite with curated prompts and expected correct or incorrect responses. When changes are made—such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation optimization, or knowledge base expansions—this suite enables automated validation of their impact. A key innovation is using frontier large language models (LLMs) to evaluate responses automatically, generating detailed reports that reveal improvement areas and confirm performance gains. This systematic feedback-driven testing fosters continuous refinement while preserving quality standards. Validation studies show measurable boosts in reliability and consistency. In various educational contexts, the framework identifies edge cases, maintains consistency across iterations, and provides actionable insights. Automated testing is especially beneficial for assistants with extensive knowledge bases and complex interaction patterns. This work advances educational AI by providing a robust methodology for quality assurance and ongoing improvement of learning assistants. Its structured feedback and automated evaluations ensure alignment with educational goals while refining assistants over time. The enhanced LAMB framework offers a scalable and reliable solution for educators aiming to integrate AI-driven support into their LMS environments.

PY  - 2025
DO  - 10.48550/arXiv.2503.16434
AB  - Humans have long relied on visual aids like sketches and diagrams to support reasoning and problem-solving. Visual tools, like auxiliary lines in geometry or graphs in calculus, are essential for understanding complex ideas. However, many tutoring systems remain text-based, providing feedback only through natural language. Leveraging recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), this paper introduces Interactive Sketchpad, a tutoring system that combines language-based explanations with interactive visualizations to enhance learning. Built on a pre-trained LMM, Interactive Sketchpad is fine-tuned to provide step-by-step guidance in both text and visuals, enabling natural multimodal interaction with the student. Accurate and robust diagrams are generated by incorporating code execution into the reasoning process. User studies conducted on math problems such as geometry, calculus, and trigonometry demonstrate that Interactive Sketchpad leads to improved task comprehension, problem-solving accuracy, and engagement levels, highlighting its potential for transforming educational technologies.

AB  - Digital education has gained popularity in the last decade, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. With the improving capabilities of large language models to reason and communicate with users, envisioning intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that can facilitate self-learning is not very far-fetched. One integral component to fulfill this vision is the ability to give accurate and effective feedback via hints to scaffold the learning process. In this survey article, we present a comprehensive review of prior research on hint generation, aiming to bridge the gap between research in education and cognitive science, and research in AI and Natural Language Processing. Informed by our findings, we propose a formal definition of the hint generation task, and discuss the roadmap of building an effective hint generation system aligned with the formal definition, including open challenges, future directions and ethical considerations.

DO  - 10.48550/arXiv.2411.14730
AB  - As educational institutions grapple with teaching students about increasingly complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, finding effective methods for explaining these technologies and their societal implications remains a major challenge. This study proposes a methodological approach combining Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) with UNESCO's AI competency framework to develop Critical AI Literacy (CAIL). Through a systematic analysis of metaphors commonly used to describe AI systems, we develop criteria for selecting pedagogically appropriate metaphors and demonstrate their alignment with established AI literacy competencies, as well as UNESCO's AI competency framework. Our method identifies and suggests four key metaphors for teaching CAIL. This includes GenAI as an echo chamber, GenAI as a funhouse mirror, GenAI as a black box magician, and GenAI as a map. Each of these seeks to address specific aspects of understanding characteristics of AI, from filter bubbles to algorithmic opacity. We present these metaphors alongside interactive activities designed to engage students in experiential learning of AI concepts. In doing so, we offer educators a structured approach to teaching CAIL that bridges technical understanding with societal implications. This work contributes to the growing field of AI education by demonstrating how carefully selected metaphors can make complex technological concepts more accessible while promoting critical engagement with AI systems.

AB  - In order to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage in today’s global economy, organizations need to align their information technology (IT) with their strategy while lowering the cost of ownership of their IT. To do so, an increasing number of organizations are adopting The Open Group Architecture Framework Architecture Development Method (TOGAF ADM). Indeed, this method seems to be the most widely adopted, complete and promising EA method. However, understanding and applying this method well is not as simple as it seems. The objective of the present research is to design and develop a tutoring artifact that implements the core concepts of intelligent tutoring systems to facilitate and accelerate the learning of the fundamental concepts of the TOGAF ADM. To attain this objective, we adopt a design science approach (DSA). This research contributes to the literature by synthesizing and clarifying key writings on the ADM. Furthermore, the proposed artifact, in addition to addressing an unmet need in the market, also helps users be rapidly more proficient in their work which in turn should enable their organizations to be more effective, agile and efficient.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various sectors, and its impact on education, specifically in personalized learning, is increasingly significant. Personalized learning aims to cater to individual students‘ unique needs, learning styles, and abilities, enabling them to achieve better educational outcomes. AI technologies offer the potential to transform traditional educational models by providing adaptive and tailored approaches that enhance student engagement, learning efficiency, and overall educational experiences. This abstract provides an overview of the role of AI in personalized learning and highlights its key benefits and challenges. The abstract also explores various AI-powered tools and techniques used in personalized learning environments, such as intelligent tutoring systems, recommendation engines, and adaptive assessments. These tools leverage machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and data analytics to gather and analyze vast amounts of educational data, providing valuable insights for personalized instruction. AI in personalized learning facilitates adaptive content delivery, enabling students to learn at their own pace and according to their individual strengths and weaknesses. Intelligent tutoring systems, for instance, offer customized feedback, explanations, and recommendations based on real-time student interactions, fostering deeper comprehension and engagement. Moreover, AI-powered recommendation engines provide personalized learning resources and materials that align with students’ interests, preferences, and skill levels, creating a more tailored and immersive learning experience. While AI in personalized learning presents numerous benefits, it also poses certain challenges. Privacy concerns, ethical considerations, and potential biases in AI algorithms must be carefully addressed to ensure the responsible and equitable use of these technologies. Furthermore, effective implementation requires adequate infrastructure, access to quality data, and teacher training to leverage AI tools optimally.

AB  - In this work, we investigated off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) metrics to evaluate Reinforcement Learning (RL) induced policies and to identify critical decisions in the context of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). We explore the use of three common Importance Sampling based OPE metrics in two deployment settings to evaluate four RL-induced policies for a logic ITS. The two deployment settings explore the impact of using original or normalized rewards, and the impact of transforming deterministic to stochastic policies. Our results show that Per Decision Importance Sampling (PDIS), using soft max and original rewards, is the best metric, and the only metric that reached 100% alignment between the theoretical and empirical classroom evaluation results. Furthermore, we used PDIS to identify what we call critical decisions in RL-induced policies, where the policies successfully identify large differences between decisions. We found that the students who received more critical decisions significantly outperformed those who received less; more importantly, this result only holds on the policy that was identified to be effective using PDIS, not on ineffective ones.

AB  - As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in academic fields increases, it has become necessary to evaluate its effectiveness before integrating it extensively into the training of school teachers. While AI is known to improve pre-service teachers’ classroom management skills, its role in improving their learning outcomes is understudied. This descriptive study aimed to examine whether the use of artificial intelligence (AI) improves the learning outcomes of pre-service social studies teachers in Kuwait. A questionnaire survey was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 100 female teachers at Kuwait University's College of Education. The data were analyzed using SPSS software and simple linear regression analysis to derive Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Cronbach's alpha, means, frequencies, percentages, and standard deviations. The results revealed that using AI applications significantly enhanced the participants' learning outcomes, indicating AI’s potential to transform educator training. Pre-service teachers demonstrated a strong grasp of AI's value in education and proficiency in integrating AI into their lessons. They effectively utilized Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and Smart Content, highlighting their ability to leverage advanced AI tools to enhance teaching strategies and student engagement. This study highlights the critical role of AI in contemporary education, contributes to the theoretical literature, and paves the way for further research. Moreover, it holds practical significance as the findings can be used to extensively adopt AI-supported learning in teacher preparation courses to align teaching methods with modern educational trends.

AB  - Studying automata theory exposes the students to the theoretical foundation of Computer Science where they learn abstraction, generalization, and reasoning. However, teaching and learning automata is challenging because of the involved abstract notions and mathematical background. Many students experience difficulty in understanding the computability concepts. Recent advances in teaching the course focus on the development of different pedagogical tools that can be used to facilitate the learning of automata theory and formal languages. Developments of tutoring systems for automata, like simulators, are continuously advancing. Fundamental efforts on features of automata simulators, based on the open literature, are focused on the following: visual creation, animation, conversion (transformation), interaction, logs generation, and saving and exporting facility. They do not support customization based on learners' performance in the tutor environment, like provision of individualized learning path and feedback. While these existing tutors facilitate teaching and understanding of the concepts, they do not focus on identifying whether learning is achieved. Another factor that mediates student achievement is goal orientation. This theory suggests that students' behavior and response to the learning environment are guided by goals. Some students are performance-oriented while others are mastery-oriented. These personal goals interact with the learning environment, sometimes referred to as classroom goals. How these classroom goals align with students' individual goals can have an effect on both a student's achievement and learning experience. Hence, the first goal of this study is to augment the capabilities of an automata simulator to characterize Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that is driven by a learner model to support individualized learning path, feedback, and support. The second goal of this work is to include features in the ITS that are intended to cater to the different achievement goal orientations of learners. The last goal would be to determine relationships among learners' in-tutor behavior, their goal orientations, and learning.

AB  - Transforming information in a digital way modifies the people views and their daily functioning. Social media is a key platform where people express their views regarding any event and it also plays an important role in daily activities. Digital marketing is an example of such digital transformation of information. In this present era, social channels use their personal information of the users to launch any product or tool. Digital Education plays a key role in transforming information in a digital way. In such cases, Natural Language Processing of people views and blog chatting plays an important role. Adding an explanatory layer is important for an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), where students interact with an application through natural language. This paper proposed a method, which will able to measure the interpretability between two sentences by rating the degree of semantic equivalence on a graded scale from 0 (not aligned) to 5 (semantically equivalent). The goal of the paper is not to add an interpretable layer but developed a method which can explain the similarities and differences between the two sentences. This task has been motivated by SemEval 2016 Task 2. The proposed method has been developed and tested over the headlines dataset. For the gold standard data, an accuracy of 0.64 for alignment type and score is reported.

AB  - As we witness groundbreaking advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is clear that the next generation must be equipped with AI literacy: the skill to interact, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems. This study introduces ActiveAI, a scalable web-based tutoring system aligned with AI4K12’s five big ideas in AI, designed to foster AI literacy among K-12 students through active learning and interaction with intelligent agents. A controlled classroom study involving 171 middle school learners was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ActiveAI in fostering AI literacy skills and competency toward AI. Results showed that, compared to students in the tell-and-practice control condition, students who used ActiveAI exhibited higher post-test performance in the module about how next-word prediction and temperature work in large language models. Students also developed higher self-reported competence toward AI after using ActiveAI than in the control condition. We conclude by suggesting assessment designs that promote deeper engagement with AI concepts by addressing students’ common misconceptions, like “AI thinks just like humans”, in K-12 AI literacy education.

AB  - Personalized e-learning systems have transformed the delivery of educational content, aligning it more closely with individual learners' needs. Among the various approaches to achieving this personalization, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality prediction emerged as a valuable tool for adapting learning content to match individual preferences and learning styles. Despite these advancements, personalized e-learning systems quite struggle with handling large volumes of information, often facing difficulties in balancing prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. To ensure personalization, integrating advanced technologies such as machine learning and deep learning is crucial for creating more sustainable and effective learning environments. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates MBTI personality prediction with a deep learning approach and a Learner Profile ontology (LPO) to enhance the personalization and recommendation process. The proposed method employs the BERT model, a Transformer-based architecture, for personality prediction, combined with an oversampling technique to handle data imbalance. The predicted personality type is incorporated into a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)-based ontology enriched with WordNet, enabling better alignment of learning resources with individual learner traits. Experimental results validate the efficacy of this integrated approach, demonstrating significant improvements in learner satisfaction and educational outcomes.

AB  - The increasing significance of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries highlights the necessity for industry leaders and professionals to comprehend and gain knowledge about AI. The urgency for AI literacy is more critical than ever due to the potential unethical use of AI resulting from insufficient knowledge. This issue is particularly crucial for educators because they need to understand and adapt to the impact of AI within educational institutions, with some needing to use and become literate in AI, given that students now have increased access to public AI tools. This research presents a multi-phase study to address the issue of bridging the knowledge gap in AI by conducting co-creation with innovation champions, illustrated by a case of Generative AI innovation in a K-12 school. Using action design research, we engaged experienced teachers who are experts in pedagogical innovation to co-create a generative AI-enhanced platform at a leading K-12 education institution known for its pedagogical innovation in Australia. The findings reveal that champions enhance their knowledge through their subject-matter expertise, organizational knowledge, and AI knowledge gained through external exposure and experience. The study also highlights the key elements that facilitate a cross-domain knowledge exchange platform, enabling champions to be exposed to and experience AI technological learning, leading to shifts in their understanding and perception of AI. The initially unaware and sceptical champions become more aware and capable of articulating more technical AI knowledge rooted in a shared value. This research demonstrates how co-creation serves as a pathway for learning AI, particularly among K-12 teachers who are innovation champions. It underscores the impact of experiential and organizational learning on AI collaborative learning and behavioral intentions. Additionally, the study presents that aligning organizational and personal visions and values can influence perceptions about AI technologies, enhancing the discourse on AI and education innovation.

AB  - This paper represents the Phase II report of the Management Curriculum for the Digital Era (MaCuDE) disciplinary task force on information systems (IS). Aligned with the current work of the AIS (Association for Information Systems) and ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), we focus on the current and future industry driven educational needs and requirements posed by big data analytics (BDA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and related innovations. In this report, we probe and report on the views of industry leaders regarding BDA/AI education needs. We conducted 18 rich semi-structured interviews with a representative sample of industry leaders around key changes and issues related to workforce demands in digital transformation and associated educational needs. We performed a grounded theory based analysis of key themes in reported education needs. We note the shifting meaning of AI and BDA phenomena and identify three main organizational level needs for the digital era-capability improvement and transformation, decision-making strategies and tactics, and changes in operations or products-and connect them to three individual professional competencies-fundamental environmental competencies, data information and content, and system design competencies-necessary to deliver them. Based on the analysis we outline several novel competency-based IS curriculum recommendations for the master's and undergraduate level IS education.

AB  - Moral stories are a time-tested vehicle for transmitting values, yet modern NLP lacks a large, structured corpus that couples coherent narratives with explicit ethical lessons. We close this gap with TF1-EN-3M, the first open dataset of three million English-language fables generated exclusively by instruction-tuned models no larger than 8B parameters. Each story follows a six-slot scaffold (character -> trait -> setting -> conflict -> resolution -> moral), produced through a combinatorial prompt engine that guarantees genre fidelity while covering a broad thematic space. A hybrid evaluation pipeline blends (i) a GPT-based critic that scores grammar, creativity, moral clarity, and template adherence with (ii) reference-free diversity and readability metrics. Among ten open-weight candidates, an 8B-parameter Llama-3 variant delivers the best quality-speed trade-off, producing high-scoring fables on a single consumer GPU (<24 GB VRAM) at approximately 13.5 cents per 1,000 fables. We release the dataset, generation code, evaluation scripts, and full metadata under a permissive license, enabling exact reproducibility and cost benchmarking. TF1-EN-3M opens avenues for research in instruction following, narrative intelligence, value alignment, and child-friendly educational AI, demonstrating that large-scale moral storytelling no longer requires proprietary giant models.

AB  - The pandemic has catalyzed a significant shift to online/blended teaching and learning where teachers apply emerging technologies to enhance their students’ learning outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has gained its popularity in online learning environments during the pandemic to assist students’ learning. However, many of these AI tools are new to teachers. They may not have rich technical knowledge to use AI educational applications to facilitate their teaching, not to mention developing students’ AI digital capabilities. As such, there is a growing need for teachers to equip themselves with adequate digital competencies so as to use and teach AI in their teaching environments. There are few existing frameworks informing teachers of necessary AI competencies. This study first explores the opportunities and challenges of employing AI systems and how they can enhance teaching, learning and assessment. Then, aligning with generic digital competency frameworks, the DigCompEdu framework and P21’s framework for twenty-first century learning were adapted and revised to accommodate AI technologies. Recommendations are proposed to support educators and researchers to promote AI education in their classrooms and academia.

AB  - Estimates predict a global deficit of 4 million software engineers by 2025, further complicated by the software engineering (SE) industry's escalating use of artificial intelligence (AI). To tackle this issue, our research suggests that computer science (CS) curricula in middle and high schools need to be updated to incorporate SE industry segments that significantly employ AI. This strategic curriculum alignment is significant for preparing a workforce equipped to meet future industry demands. Our initial analysis involved reviewing nine international AI education guidelines to evaluate current methods for integrating AI into SE education. The findings indicated a pronounced lack of specific guidance connecting AI applications in the SE industry with educational content. To address this, we performed a systematic literature review of 12 research papers focusing on AI's role across the SE industry, followed by multiple rounds of inductive content analysis. An industry segment was deemed "essential" if it was referenced in 75% or more of the papers' findings. Through this method, we identified 10 essential SE industry segments for inclusion in CS education: software development, software maintenance, process improvement, software economics, knowledge management, project management, software testing, software security, quality assurance, and deployment and operations (DevOps). These findings led to the creation of the AI-USE (Artificial Intelligence Usage in Software Engineering) framework, which maps these 10 key segments to the predominant uses of SE in the industry as identified in the literature. Further inductive content analysis helped us develop subsegments for these essential areas. Ongoing framework development involves refining these subsegments and gathering feedback from industry and academic professionals. We anticipate that the fully developed AI-USE framework will significantly enhance SE education, equipping the next generation of software engineers with the AI proficiency required to address the industry’s evolving demands.

AB  - When collaborating with artificial intelligence (AI), humans can often delegate tasks to leverage complementary AI competencies. However, humans often delegate inefficiently. Enabling humans with knowledge about AI can potentially improve inefficient AI delegation. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (two groups, n = 111) to examine how enabling humans with AI knowledge can improve AI delegation in human-AI collaboration. We find that AI knowledge-enabled humans align their delegation decisions more closely with their assessment of how suitable a task is for humans or AI (i.e., task appraisal). We show that delegation decisions closely aligned with task appraisal increase task performance. However, we also find that AI knowledge lowers future intentions to use AI, suggesting that AI knowledge is not strictly positive for human-AI collaboration. Our study contributes to HCI design guidelines with a new perspective on AI features, educating humans regarding general AI functioning and their own (human) performance and biases.

AB  - Attention in the AI safety community has increasingly started to include strategic considerations of coordination between relevant actors in the field of AI and AI safety, in addition to the steadily growing work on the technical considerations of building safe AI systems. This shift has several reasons: Multiplier effects, pragmatism, and urgency. Given the benefits of coordination between those working towards safe superintelligence, this book surveys promising research in this emerging field regarding AI safety. On a meta-level, the hope is that this book can serve as a map to inform those working in the field of AI coordination about other promising efforts. While this book focuses on AI safety coordination, coordination is important to most other known existential risks (e.g., biotechnology risks), and future, human-made existential risks. Thus, while most coordination strategies in this book are specific to superintelligence, we hope that some insights yield “collateral benefits” for the reduction of other existential risks, by creating an overall civilizational framework that increases robustness, resiliency, and antifragility.
