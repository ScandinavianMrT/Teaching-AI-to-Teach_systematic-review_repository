AB  - The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured public imagination and represent a marked improvement in AI in Education (AIED) capabilities. But there is concern that student reliance on automated tools to complete written assignments may lead to a decline in learning. This study investigated whether participant use of LLMs to complete a writing assignment affected retention of learning content. Undergraduate participants (N= 109) were randomly assigned to complete a writing assignment under one of three conditions: (1), with the assistance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based AI psychology tutor; (2) with the assistance of unmodified GPT-4 Turbo; (3) with no AI assistance. After completing the writing task, students completed a posttest quiz to assess their retention of learning material. The control condition had the lowest mean quiz score (M= 9.22, SD = 3.90), followed by the RAG AI tutor condition (M = 10.81, SD = 4.12), and unmodified GPT-4Turbo (M= 11.31, SD = 3.88), with significant differences between the AI tutor condition and the control condition (p =.036); and between the GPT-4 Turbo condition and control (p =.003); but not between the AI tutor and GPT-4 Turbo conditions (p=.283). © 2024 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Willingness to communicate (WTC) has been identified as a crucial factor in improving EFL learners' speaking. However, enhancing WTC often remains a major challenge. The recent emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded for its transformative potential, yet there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding how this development influences WTC. To address this, our pioneering study investigates the impact of two major AI tools on EFL learners from China, one involving a chatbot and the other an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). 82 first-year undergraduates participated in the study and were assigned to two groups: the AI chatbot group and the ITS group. Pre- and post-session WTC questionnaires, reflection journals and a teacher interview were conducted to collect data. Results revealed significant disparities in WTC changes among the groups. Specifically, the chatbot group displayed significant improvements, while the WTC of the ITS group surprisingly declined. The study delves into the reasons behind these contrasting performances. It concludes by proposing practical implications based on the findings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Conversational chatbots, fueled by large language models, spark debate over their potential in education and medical career exams. There is debate in the literature about the scientific integrity of the outputs produced by these chatbots. Aims: This study evaluates ChatGPT 3.5 and Perplexity AI's cross-sectional performance in responding to questions from the 2023 Italian national residency admission exam (SSM23), comparing results and chatbots' concordance with previous years SSMs. Methods: Gastroenterology-related SSM23 questions were input into ChatGPT 3.5 and Perplexity AI, evaluating their performance in correct responses and total scores. This process was repeated with questions from the three preceding years. Additionally, chatbot concordance was assessed using Cohen's method. Results: In SSM23, ChatGPT 3.5 outperforms Perplexity AI with 94.11% correct responses, demonstrating consistency across years. Concordance weakened in 2023 (κ=0.203, P = 0.148), but ChatGPT consistently maintains a high standard compared to Perplexity AI. Conclusion: ChatGPT 3.5 and Perplexity AI exhibit promise in addressing gastroenterological queries, emphasizing potential educational roles. However, their variable performance mandates cautious use as supplementary tools alongside conventional study methods. Clear guidelines are crucial for educators to balance traditional approaches and innovative systems, enhancing educational standards. © 2024 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

AB  - The advent of generative AI has caused both excitement and anxiety among educators. Some school systems have gone so far as to ban it altogether. Generative AI has the potential to transform human learning; but like any new technology, it has both strengths and weaknesses, and adopting it involves some risks. There are risks that generative AI will mislead learners with wrong information, or that learners will use it to do their homework and take tests for them. This article presents some ways to take best advantage of generative AI, while managing and mitigating the risks. It also suggests some uses of generative AI to avoid. These insights are informed by learning science and extensive experience developing AI-enabled learning products. If applied properly, generative AI can dramatically accelerate human learning and do so at scale. © International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society 2023.

AB  - The ability of children to ask curiosity-driven questions is an important skill that helps improve their learning. For this reason, previous research has explored designing specific exercises to train this skill. Several of these studies relied on providing semantic and linguistic cues to train them to ask more of such questions (also called divergent questions). But despite showing pedagogical efficiency, this method is still limited as it relies on generating the said cues by hand, which can be a very long and costly process. In this context, we propose to leverage advances in the natural language processing field (NLP) and investigate the efficiency of using a large language model (LLM) for automating the production of key parts of pedagogical content within a curious question-asking (QA) training. We study generating the said content using the "prompt-based" method that consists of explaining the task to the LLM in natural text. We evaluate the output using human experts annotations and comparisons with hand-generated content. Results suggested indeed the relevance and usefulness of this content. We then conduct a field study in primary school (75 children aged 9–10), where we evaluate children’s QA performance when having this training. We compare 3 types of content: 1) hand-generated content that proposes "closed" cues leading to predefined questions; 2) GPT-3-generated content that proposes the same type of cues; 3) GPT-3-generated content that proposes "open" cues leading to several possible questions. Children were assigned to either one of these groups. Based on human annotations of the questions generated, we see a similar QA performance between the two "closed" trainings (showing the scalability of the approach using GPT-3), and a better one for participants with the "open" training. These results suggest the efficiency of using LLMs to support children in generating more curious questions, using a natural language prompting approach that affords usability by teachers and other users not specialists of AI techniques. Furthermore, results also show that open-ended content may be more suitable for training curious question-asking skills. © International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society 2023.

AB  - The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), including large language models (LLM), has merged to support students in their academic writing process. Keeping pace with the technical and educational landscape requires careful consideration of the opportunities and challenges that GenAI-assisted systems create within education. This serves as a useful and necessary starting point for fully leveraging its potential for learning and teaching. Hence, it is crucial to gather insights from diverse perspectives and use cases from actual users, particularly the unique voices and needs of student-users. Therefore, this study explored and examined students' perceptions and experiences about GenAI-assisted academic writing by conducting in-depth interviews with 20 Chinese students in higher education after completing academic writing tasks using a ChatGPT4-embedded writing system developed by the research team. The study found that students expected AI to serve multiple roles, including multi-tasking writing assistant, virtual tutor, and digital peer to support multifaceted writing processes and performance. Students perceived that GenAI-assisted writing could benefit them in three areas including the writing process, performance, and their affective domain. Meanwhile, they also identified AI-related, student-related, and task-related challenges that were experienced during the GenAI-assisted writing activity. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of GenAI's impact on academic writing that is inclusive of student perspectives, offering implications for educational AI design and instructional design. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study ventures into the expanding role of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education and its potential to revolutionize the learning experience. Through a qualitative approach, we investigate how advanced AI-driven educational tools can enhance learning systems through tailored learning experiences, AI-powered adaptive tutoring platforms, immersive digital learning environments, and AI-assisted assessment and feedback systems. From a theoretical perspective, we utilize the constructivist theory of learning as a study framework to explain the role of technology in AI-facilitated personalized and collaborative knowledge construction. This study was executed in three stages. First, we present a brief overview of AI and its recent impact on the education system, including its ethical considerations and implementation hurdles. In the second stage, we propose the potential implications for learning contexts through the constructivist lens, the process of AI-supported cognitive development, and the use of AI tools for optimizing educational processes through AI and transformation in educational paradigms and study work. The findings suggest that institutions can unlock new opportunities for efficiency, accessibility, and personalized learning by adopting AI technology, but they also highlight the need to address ethical considerations and implementation hurdles. This study also contributes to future studies by examining the impact of AI on student outcomes, teacher roles, and institutional practices in education, as well as exploring ethical and equity concerns in AI-driven educational settings. © 2024 by the authors of this article.

AB  - Automated written corrective feedback (AWCF) has been widely applied in second language (L2) writing classrooms in the past few decades. Recently, the introduction of tools based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) such as ChatGPT heralds groundbreaking changes in the conceptualization and practice of AWCF in L2 pedagogy. However, students’ engagement in such an interactive and intelligent learning environment remains unstudied. The present study aims to investigate L2 writers’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement with ChatGPT as an AWCF provider for writing products. This mixed-method multiple case study explored four L2 writers’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement with AWCF provided by ChatGPT. Bearing the conversational and generative mechanisms of ChatGPT in mind, data on students’ engagement were collected from various sources: prompt writing techniques, revision operations, utilization of metacognitive and cognitive strategies, and attitudinal responses to the feedback. The results indicated that: 1) behavioral engagement was related to their individual differences in language proficiencies and technological competencies; 2) the participants have failed to metacognitively regulate the learning processes in an effective manner; and 3) ChatGPT ushered in an affectively engaging, albeit competence-demanding and time-consuming, learning environment for L2 writers. The study delivers conceptual and pedagogical implications for educators and researchers poised to incorporate GAI-based technologies in language education. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of advanced large language models (LLMs) including GPT, BART, BERT, and T5, fine-tuned using a specialized FAQ dataset from ESTIN, a higher education institution. The study aims to assess the performance of these LLM models in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses to common queries. These models were evaluated using key metrics such as evaluation loss (eval loss) and ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2), which measure the alignment between the generated responses and the reference answers. The experiment results show that BERT outperforms the other models, achieving a lowest eval loss and highest ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, making it the most effective model in this context. The findings underscore the potential of BERT in educational AI applications. Finally, some future research directions are discussed, including the integration of additional models and the enhancement of the FAQ dataset to further improve performance. ©2024 IEEE.

AB  - Personalized learning refers to a system of teaching and learning where the content, methods, and assessment are tailored to each learner's needs, capacities/skills/competencies, and pace. There is abundant literature about personalized learning, describing its advantages, challenges, and approaches to implementing it. This study has explored the abundant literature and realized that while there are substantial proposed ways to achieve personalized learning, these proposals are not implemented into actionable products. This research aims to construct a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tutor that implements personalized learning and teaching in a higher education level course. The research methodology involved exploring literature to determine the requirements for personalized learning and designing a tutor system. The resultant system uses Custom GPT technology, Application Programming Interface (API), a repository for storing content, learners' profile information, and performance metrics. Out of the six components that make the proposed system, only the 'Custom GPT' component has been implemented and tested on a course named 'Applied Cryptography' in a postgraduate program. Though the preliminary results are promising, an effective assessment of the system will be made when the full implementation is completed. Further, issues related to ethics, scaling and integration with learning management systems should also be considered. Subsequent work to this study will focus on those issues. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The development of technology has marked great changes in all areas, especially in education, the incorporation of various tools supported by artificial intelligence has brought positive and negative consequences, in many cases there is a lack of knowledge of these and therefore they have not been properly used. This study attempts to evaluate and compare some generative language tools through a literature search and their practical use. Using content analysis, the seven selected tools were compared considering the criteria of: Efficiency, Quality, Usability, Scalability and Costs. The results show that tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Whisper, Hugging Face and Grammarly stand out for their high efficiency, quality, usability and scalability, being the most robust options for various educational applications. While tools such as Google Bard and Khan Academy's AI Tutor offer good evaluations in usability and scalability, with relatively low costs, making them accessible and effective in educational environments. Some limitations were identified in tools such as Talk to Books and ChatPDF that present challenges in efficiency and usability, limiting their applicability compared to more advanced tools. In addition, GPT for Slides, although functional for presentations, shows limitations in scalability and security. It was identified that there is a positive correlation between efficiency and quality in most tools, although there are exceptions where these aspects are not aligned. It is concluded that generative tools in Higher Education are crucial to modernize teaching and are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Choosing the right tool should consider factors such as security, costs and ease of use to maximize its educational impact. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Ongoing advancements in generative AI (GenAI) have boosted the potential of applying long-standing “learning-by-teaching” practices in the form of a teachable agent (TA). Despite the recognized roles and opportunities of TAs, less is known about how GenAI could create synergy or introduce challenges in TAs and how students perceived the application of GenAI in TAs. This study explored middle school students’ perceived roles, benefits, and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs in an authentic mathematics classroom. Through classroom observation, focus-group interviews, and open-ended surveys of 108 sixth-grade students, we found that students expected the GenAI-powered TA to serve as a learning companion, facilitator, and collaborative problem-solver. Students also expressed the benefits and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs. This study provides implications for the design of educational AI and AI-assisted instruction. © 2025 ISTE.

AB  - In many post-Colonial African countries, English is the medium of instruction at schools and universities. Many, if not most of the students, however, are not home language English speakers. In the specific situation of Zimbabwe, approximately eighty percent of the population is Shona speaking and approximately ten percent of the population is Ndebele speaking. Existing research shows that when learners or students are forced to learn technical subjects (such as mathematics and computer programming) in their non-home language, they are doing double work. Not only do they need to learn the new subject domain, they also need to translate these new terms to and from their home language. This paper investigates the use of an GPT-4 based artificially intelligent tutoring bot configured to tutor the subject of Python Programming in both Shona and Ndebele. This paper is the first step of a multi-step research project which has the final goal of helping Zimbabwean learners and students learn Python Programming in their home language. This first step, however, reports on language evaluations of the GPT-4 based tutoring bot operating in Shona and Ndebele.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The recent emergence of generative AI (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Gemini have introduced revolutionary capabilities that are predicted to transform numerous facets of society fundamentally. In higher education (HE), the advent of GenAI presents a pivotal moment that may profoundly alter learning and teaching practices in aspects such as inaccuracy, bias, overreliance on technology and algorithms, and limited access to educational AI resources that require in-depth investigation. To evaluate the implications of adopting GenAI in HE, a team of academics and field experts have co-authored this paper, which analyzes the potential for the responsible integration of GenAI into HE and provides recommendations about this integration. This paper recommends strategies for integrating GenAI into HE to create the following positive outcomes: raise awareness about disruptive change, train faculty, change teaching and assessment practices, partner with students, impart AI learning literacies, bridge the digital divide, and conduct applied research. Finally, we propose four preliminary scale levels of a GenAI adoption for faculty. At each level, we suggest courses of action to facilitate progress to the next stage in the adoption of GenAI. This study offers a valuable set of recommendations to decision-makers and faculty, enabling them to prepare for the responsible and judicious integration of GenAI into HE. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Recent advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) were accompanied by both hype and fear regarding the ways in which such technologies of automation would replace human labor in various fields, including education. Rather than focusing on the replacement of humans in teaching, this piece uses new materialist thought [Barad, Karen. 2007. Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.] to consider how a new subjectivity, the centaur, might offer a different orientation toward GenAI technologies as tools that possess potentiality for new becomings in teaching. This theoretical piece looks at three AI education (AIED) platforms as a means of diagnosing how current models of AI tools attempt to design for teacher-centaurs by ushering in a more productive teacher workforce. The article also offers an alternative perspective of what might be considered centaur teaching practices, entangling humans and AI in ways that imagine how human-technical relations might be otherwise. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) ushers in a new era in education, characterized by more adaptive, personalized learning experiences. This literature review examines the profound impact of these technologies on student engagement, achievement, and personalized learning within higher education institutions. Through a systematic analysis of scholarly articles from 2022 to 2024, this review explores how AI is reshaping educational practices through enhanced feedback mechanisms, predictive analytics, and innovative teaching methodologies. The findings indicate that AI significantly improves student support services by enabling early identification of at-risk students and by facilitating tailored educational interventions. Moreover, the deployment of chatbots and LLMs, such as GPT (generative pretrained transformer) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers), offers promising enhancements in instructional strategies and student assessments, fostering richer, interactive learning environments. However, the integration of these technologies also introduces ethical challenges, necessitating consideration of issues such as data privacy and bias. The review emphasizes the need for ethical frameworks and responsible AI usage to ensure technology enhances educational outcomes without compromising fairness or integrity. Future research directions are suggested, focusing on broader AI applications across various educational settings and the need for longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of AI integration in education. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.

AB  - Notwithstanding the growing advantages of incorporating Augmented Reality (AR) in science education, the pedagogical use of AR combined with Pedagogical Agents (PAs) remains underexplored. Additionally, few studies have examined the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into science education to create GAI-enhanced PAs (GPAs) that enrich the learning experiences. To address these gaps, this study designed and implemented a GPA-enhanced 5E model within AR environments to scaffold students’ science learning. A mixed-methods design was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on students’ academic achievement, cognitive load, and their perceptions of GPAs as learning aids through using the 5E model. Sixty sixth-grade students from two complete classes were randomly assigned to either an experimental group engaged in AR science learning with a GPA-enhanced 5E approach or a control group that followed the traditional 5E method. The findings revealed that the GPA-enhanced 5E approach in AR environments significantly improved students’ academic achievement and decreased cognitive load. Furthermore, students in the experimental group reported positive perceptions of the GPA-enhanced 5E method during the AR science lessons. The findings offer valuable insights for instructional designers and educators who leverage advanced educational technologies to support science learning aligned with constructivist principles. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Adaptive instruction is a promising solution to the limitations of traditional classroom instruction, which assumes that all students learn in the same way and at the same pace. Adaptive instruction tailors the learning experience to each student’s needs and abilities. Several adaptive instruction tools and platforms exist, including intelligent tutoring systems, learning management systems, mobile apps, AI chatbots, and adaptive machine-learning programs. The Adaptive Instruction of Student Control Theoretical Framework suggests that allowing students to control their use of learning resources leads to better learning outcomes. Implementing adaptive instruction in higher education can be difficult due to faculty buy-in, technical infrastructure, and student motivation. Effective instructional design is crucial for adaptive instruction to support student control and maximize benefits. Overall, instructors must pay attention to student motivation and work to create learning environments that foster motivation, autonomy, and engagement to implement adaptive instruction successfully. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Despite the critical role teachers play in AI education, research on their understanding of generative AI tools remains limited, particularly concerning their ethical assessment knowledge. This study addresses the gap by proposing the Generative AI Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (GenAI-TPACK) framework, which incorporates ethical knowledge as an essential component of university teachers’ professional development. Grounded in the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, we utilize structural equation modeling to investigate the interrelationships among Generative AI Technological Knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and ethical assessment knowledge. Our findings indicate that university teachers’ effective use of generative AI is contingent upon their technological knowledge and engagement with these tools. Furthermore, while technical knowledge supports evaluative decision-making, it is insufficient on its own for successful integration into teaching practices. Instead, a holistic approach that combines technological and pedagogical knowledge enhances teachers’ capacities to utilize generative AI effectively. The study also reveals a positive correlation between ethical assessment knowledge and both pedagogical and content knowledge, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the GenAI-TPACK framework. This research underscores the importance of integrating ethical considerations into AI education, offering valuable insights for the professional development of educators and the enhancement of teacher training programs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - AI tools, such as intelligent tutoring systems, chatbots, and adaptive learning platforms, allow instructors to design teaching strategies based on individual student needs, learning styles, and progress. This exploratory study discussed the implications of AI use in classrooms for student’s critical thinking. Science, mathematics, and language instructors (n=40) were purposively sampled to be interviewed in the study. Narrative data was analyzed for recurring themes through reflexive thematic analysis. Findings indicated that AI has an alternate purpose in developing and possibly obstructing students’ critical thinking skills. AI tools like chatbots and personalized learning systems can enhance critical thinking by promoting cognitive flexibility, reflective thinking, and systematic analysis. Teachers use AI to encourage students to analyze AI-generated results and compare them to theoretical frameworks, developing deeper engagement with content across subjects like science, mathematics, and language. However, the study also observed that over-reliance on AI can lead to superficial understanding and uncritical acceptance of information. Students sometimes bypass the cognitive work necessary for critical thinking, treating AI as a shortcut rather than a tool for deeper learning. As such, while AI can significantly enhance learning when used appropriately, instructors must guide its use carefully to avoid negative impacts on critical thinking. © 2024 by author(s).

AB  - The Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) has gained widespread acceptance in higher education as an effective pedagogical strategy. Despite its success, the FCM still faces persistent concerns, including a lack of personalized interaction, limited application to introductory courses, and insufficient analysis of the learning process. The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) with the Metaverse may significantly enrich and revitalize FCM by introducing affordances that support personalized and immersive learning experiences. This study examined the potential of FCM enhanced by an AI-Generated Metaverse (AIGM) to improve learning outcomes in higher education. Through introducing an AI-powered virtual tutor, this study aimed to address existing concerns and shed light on the nature of knowledge-building interactions between students and the AI tutor. The study involved 94 university graduates who participated in an experimental FCM session. Data on students’ learning performance were collected through pre/posttests, pre-class video engagement, and analyzed dialogic interactions between students and the AI virtual tutor. The findings indicated that the AIGM-FCM positively influenced learners’ academic performance. Interaction patterns revealed that students predominantly engaged with the AI virtual tutor at the onset and at the end of their learning sessions, primarily for the purpose of asking questions. However, the educational dialogues suggested that the depth of collaborative knowledge construction between students and the AI tutor remained at a basic level. Notably, students with lower academic performance were more likely to initiate inquiry-based dialogues with the AI tutor compared to their higher-achieving peers exhibiting a more focusing-oriented approach. In light of these discussions, the implications of this study are also deliberated. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2025.

AB  - Contribution: This research explores the benefits and challenges of developing, deploying, and evaluating a large language model (LLM) chatbot, MoodleBot, in computer science classroom settings. It highlights the potential of integrating LLMs into LMSs like Moodle to support self-regulated learning (SRL) and help-seeking behavior. Background: Computer science educators face immense challenges incorporating novel tools into LMSs to create a supportive and engaging learning environment. MoodleBot addresses this challenge by offering an interactive platform for both students and teachers. Research Questions: Despite issues like bias, hallucinations, and teachers' and educators' resistance to embracing new (AI) technologies, this research investigates two questions: (RQ1) To what extent do students accept MoodleBot as a valuable tool for learning support? (RQ2) How accurately does MoodleBot churn out responses, and how congruent are these with the established course content? Methodology: This study reviews pedagogical literature on AI-driven chatbots and adopts the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for MoodleBot's design and data processing. The technology acceptance model (TAM) evaluates user acceptance through constructs like perceived usefulness (PU) and Ease of Use. Forty-six students participated, with 30 completing the TAM questionnaire. Findings: LLM-based chatbots like MoodleBot can significantly improve the teaching and learning process. This study revealed a high accuracy rate (88%) in providing course-related assistance. Positive responses from students attest to the efficacy and applicability of AI-driven educational tools. These findings indicate that educational chatbots are suitable for integration into courses to improve personalized learning and reduce teacher administrative burden, although improvements in automated fact-checking are needed. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant and popular form of NAI, presents a promising avenue for advancing personalized instruction via neurosymbolic educational agents. By leveraging structured knowledge, these agents can provide individualized learning experiences that align with specific learner preferences and desired learning paths, while also mitigating biases inherent in traditional AI systems. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of KGs, LLMs, and pedagogical agents – embodied characters designed to enhance learning – as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - In this study, I explore the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies in higher education, focusing on case studies and pedagogical innovations that are reshaping the learning experience. Through an in-depth analysis of key initiatives—such as Stanford University's AI-driven personalized learning platform, the AI chatbot implemented at the University of Murcia, Knewton's adaptive learning system, and the intelligent tutoring platform developed by Pai et al.—the study highlights how AI enhances learner engagement, customizes educational experiences, and improves academic outcomes. The research also critically examines the ethical challenges and policy considerations associated with AI integration in educational settings. It emphasizes the need for clear guidelines to ensure responsible and equitable use of AI, particularly in addressing issues of fairness, student welfare, and access. The paper concludes by calling for further research into the long-term implications of AI on educational equity and ethical standards in higher education. © 2024, STAR Scholars Network.

AB  - The History of Design course is a foundational component for art and design students; however, many students perceive it as abstract and unengaging, mainly due to its highly conceptual nature and traditional lecture-based teaching methods. To address these challenges, this study investigates the impact of AI-generated virtual instructors and a conversational teaching style on academic achievement, cognitive load, and student engagement in the flipped classroom. This study employed a 2 × 2 experimental design, with 124 first-year design students randomly assigned to four experimental conditions: human-formal (HF), human-conversational (HC), AI-generated-formal (AF), and AI-generated-conversational (AC). The results indicate that the AI-generated virtual instructor significantly enhances affective engagement and has a comparably beneficial effect on academic performance and cognitive load compared to the human instructor. Furthermore, the conversational teaching style considerably improves students’ academic performance, reduces cognitive load, and fosters engagement. These findings suggest that integrating generative AI tools with conversational teaching style within a flipped classroom model not only optimizes students’ learning experiences but also offers a practical framework for reducing educators’ workloads while contributing valuable insights into the application of generative AI in education. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Background: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the need to equip young students with basic AI-related knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10–12. Aims: This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment. Sample: One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72). Methods: Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance. Results: The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety. Conclusions: The DCP approach significantly improved students’ learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy. This study highlights the pedagogical value of human-AI comparisons in teaching AI, while contributing to a research agenda on the cognitive and conceptual aspects of AI education. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increasing significance of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries highlights the necessity for industry leaders and professionals to comprehend and gain knowledge about AI. The urgency for AI literacy is more critical than ever due to the potential unethical use of AI resulting from insufficient knowledge. This issue is particularly crucial for educators because they need to understand and adapt to the impact of AI within educational institutions, with some needing to use and become literate in AI, given that students now have increased access to public AI tools. This research presents a multi-phase study to address the issue of bridging the knowledge gap in AI by conducting co-creation with innovation champions, illustrated by a case of Generative AI innovation in a K-12 school. Using action design research, we engaged experienced teachers who are experts in pedagogical innovation to co-create a generative AI-enhanced platform at a leading K-12 education institution known for its pedagogical innovation in Australia. The findings reveal that champions enhance their knowledge through their subject-matter expertise, organizational knowledge, and AI knowledge gained through external exposure and experience. The study also highlights the key elements that facilitate a cross-domain knowledge exchange platform, enabling champions to be exposed to and experience AI technological learning, leading to shifts in their understanding and perception of AI. The initially unaware and sceptical champions become more aware and capable of articulating more technical AI knowledge rooted in a shared value. This research demonstrates how co-creation serves as a pathway for learning AI, particularly among K-12 teachers who are innovation champions. It underscores the impact of experiential and organizational learning on AI collaborative learning and behavioral intentions. Additionally, the study presents that aligning organizational and personal visions and values can influence perceptions about AI technologies, enhancing the discourse on AI and education innovation. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to analyze the most frequently discussed topics in the scientific discourse on artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes 52 peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2024, utilizing NLP techniques to identify prevalent unigrams, bigrams and trigrams related to AI in higher education. Findings: The analysis identifies an emerging concern with utilizing AI tools to enhance educational processes, with “Higher education,” “artificial intelligence” and “generative AI” becoming ubiquitous terms in use. LLM and ChatGPT represent types of technology that evoke potential for personalized learning and enhanced practice in instruction. Research limitations/implications: In review studies, samples with a post-secondary educational background usually restrict generalizability to school environments. Future studies can examine the long-term consequences of AI technology in extended academic environments, longitudinal studies and educational environments. Practical implications: The frequency patterns from our analysis offer essential insights for educators and administrators regarding curriculum development and teaching practices. The high occurrence of terms like “artificial intelligence” (1,193 times) and “higher education” (824 times) highlights the need for incorporating AI literacy into curricula. This integration should include guidelines for responsible AI use and training programs for faculty. The frequent mentions of “teaching learning” (226 times) and “AI education” (319 times) highlight important implications for teaching practices. Educational institutions must establish frameworks that blend traditional methods with AI-enhanced strategies, including assessment plans that consider AI tools while upholding academic integrity. Additionally, institutions should prioritize investment in AI infrastructure and support systems. Social implications: Our findings highlight important societal implications beyond education. The frequency analysis reveals concerns about educational equity, including disparities in access to AI-enhanced education, digital literacy gaps and economic barriers to adopting AI tools. Addressing these issues is vital to prevent the worsening of social inequalities. Additionally, our results emphasize the need for workforce development. Educational institutions should focus on equipping students with the AI competencies that employers demand and bridging the gap between academic training and industry needs. The policy implications of our findings are equally significant. Our analysis suggests the need for educational policies that address AI integration while establishing clear guidelines for ethical AI use in academic settings. These policies should include standards for AI tool evaluation and implementation to guide institutions' adoption decisions. The economic impact of these developments is also noteworthy, as our results indicate the potential for enhanced workforce preparedness through AI-integrated education, improved educational efficiency through automation and new opportunities for educational technology development. Originality/value: This study contributes to the field by providing an overview of prominent trends in AI within higher education, discussing the practical application, future research opportunities, and challenges associated with the responsible and effective use of AI in education. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Enhancing student engagement and comprehension is crucial for effective learning. However, tracking and improving these dynamic states in real-Time remains a significant challenge. This study addresses this gap by integrating real-Time engagement prediction from gaze data with an adaptive learning system that utilizes ChatGPT-generated summaries to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Our experiment with twenty two (N=22) university students demonstrates the effectiveness of gaze data in predicting real-Time engagement levels and the impact of adaptive interventions on student engagement, objective and subjective comprehension, and cognitive load. To predict the self-reported engagement and comprehension levels, two deep neural network models, InceptionTime and Transformers were employed. The Transformers model achieved better outcomes, with an average accuracy of 68.15% in predicting engagement levels across a 5-fold StratifiedGroupKFold cross-validation. The results revealed that the experimental group, which received the AI-driven interventions, exhibited significantly better learning outcomes, higher engagement, and better objective comprehension results compared to the control group. Additionally, we observed strong correlations between gaze metrics, engagement levels, and learning outcomes, suggesting that real-Time adaptive interventions can dynamically enhance the educational experience. This study advances the field of educational technology by demonstrating the benefits of integrating gaze tracking and AI in learning environments, laying the foundation for dynamic learning interfaces that adapt to individual engagement levels, potentially improving both comprehension and involvement. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This study examines the integration of generative AI tools into digital multimodal composition (DMC) within a multicultural context, examining their impact on students’ motivation, writing processes, and outcomes. Eleven culturally diverse students from two high schools in Hong Kong participated in the study. The study developed and employed a novel pedagogical framework, IDEA (Interpret, Design, Evaluate, and Articulate), to seamlessly incorporate generative AI into DMC practices. Data-collection methods included analysis of generative AI tool-usage history, classroom video observations, surveys, and interviews. The findings reveal that students leveraged generative AI's capabilities across five key areas: content generation, feedback and revision, multilingual support, critical thinking, and visual representation. The integration of AI tools followed distinct stages in the composition process, resulting in enhancements to the vocabulary, grammar, and structural elements of students’ work. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the intersection of generative AI, education, and multimodal literacy, with a particular emphasis on human-AI collaboration in multicultural settings. It also offers valuable insights for educators seeking to enhance students’ DMC skills through the thoughtful integration of generative AI tools, potentially increasing engagement, motivation, and creative expression among learners from diverse cultural backgrounds. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Adaptive support can help learners in Open-Ended Learning Environments (OELEs), where the free-form nature of the interaction can be confusing to students. In this paper, we design and evaluate an Intelligent Pedagogical Agent (IPA) for an OELE designed to foster Computational Thinking (CT). Specifically, we design help interventions for an in-the-wild scenario where students interact with the OELE in an unmonitored, self-directed manner. We build a student model by extracting meaningful student behaviors on real-world interaction data obtained during interaction in online classrooms and including expert insights. We show that these student models perform better than a baseline and have the potential for adaptive support in self-directed interaction with the OELE. We design an IPA with the help of teachers, leveraging the student behaviors extracted from data. Lastly, we get insights into the value of these help interventions by empirically evaluating the IPA in a formal user study. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In 2023, we developed and deployed AI-based tools in CS50 at Harvard University to provide students with 24/7 interactive assistance, approximating a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio. These tools offer code explanations, style suggestions, and responses to course-related inquiries, emulating human educators to foster critical thinking. However, maintaining alignment with instructional goals is challenging, especially with frequent updates to the underlying large language models (LLMs). We thus propose a continuous improvement process for LLM-based systems using a collaborative human-in-the-loop approach. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework for assessing and refining the performance of AI-based tutors, combining human-graded and model-graded evaluations. Using few-shot prompting and fine-tuning, we aim to ensure our AI tools adopt pedagogically sound teaching styles. Fine-tuning with a small, high-quality dataset has shown significant improvements in aligning with teaching goals, as confirmed through multi-turn conversation evaluations. Additionally, our framework includes a model-evaluation backend that teaching assistants periodically review, ensuring the AI system remains effective and aligned with instructional objectives. This paper offers insights into our methods and the impact of these AI tools on CS50 and contributes to the discourse on AI in education, showcasing scalable, personalized learning enhancements. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in education, including Islamic religious education, where it offers new opportunities to enhance learning methodologies. This study aims to analyze the integration of AI in Islamic education by evaluating its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) while categorizing its impact on cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains based on Bloom’s Taxonomy. A qualitative approach using library research methodology was employed, with data collected from academic journals, books, and research reports, analyzed through a SWOT framework. The findings indicate that AI significantly enhances cognitive and psychomotor learning in Islamic education. AI-based tools, such as ClassPoint AI, AI Chatbots, and Squirrel AI, contribute to knowledge retention, adaptive learning, and skill-based training in areas like Quranic recitation, prayer practices, and Islamic jurisprudence. However, AI remains limited in fostering affective learning, as it lacks human emotional intelligence and the ability to provide moral and ethical guidance, which are essential in Islamic education. The study also reveals challenges such as ethical concerns, technological disparities, and socio-cultural resistance in integrating AI into religious studies. Despite these limitations, AI presents significant opportunities, particularly in remote learning, personalized education, and accessibility for underserved communities. This research provides a structured evaluation of AI’s role within Bloom’s Taxonomy, offering insights into AI’s potential and limitations in Islamic education. The study contributes theoretically by linking AI-driven education with pedagogical principles, while practically, it guides educators and policymakers in strategically implementing AI while preserving Islamic ethical values. The study concludes that while AI enhances knowledge acquisition and skill-based learning, human educators remain essential for moral and ethical development. Future research should focus on developing ethical AI models, hybrid AI-human teaching approaches, and AI-driven affective learning systems to bridge gaps in AI-assisted moral and spiritual education. © 2025, Qubahan.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic that presents new challenges and opportunities for the improvement of educational processes. The disruptive and transformative force of this new technological development implies the adaptation of educational ecosystems for its use and integration as a didactic and pedagogical resource. From this perspective, a systematic literature review has been conducted to analyze the didactic potential of generative AI tools in the field of promoting artistic creativity in music education. The research results confirm that the incorporation of AI in music education is paving the way for a more personalized, interactive and efficient learning experience. In addition, the analysis suggests nine fundamental fields of IA implementation in music education: virtual and augmented reality (VR; VA); learning personalization, intelligent tutoring systems; composition assistants; improved historical and contextual learning; assessment systems; interactive ear training and music theory systems; tools for music collaboration and performance; and assistive technologies. Furthermore, the challenges presented by the intersection of AI and digital didactics in the field of music education are discussed. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In today's era of technological evolution, programming education is crucial for shaping the future workforce and fostering innovation. However, access to quality computer science education remains a significant challenge with Sub-Saharan Africa nations experiencing a pronounced digital divide. Despite growing interest in technology, these countries struggle with unequal access to educational resources. AI-driven tools like ChatGPT, Codey, and GitHub Copilot offer personalized learning experiences that could democratize access to knowledge and reshape programming education. This quantitative study examines the impact of these AI tools on fostering inclusive education in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. It involves 322 university students, using purposive sampling and online questionnaires. Various quantitative analyzes, including descriptive statistics, country-wise comparisons, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis tests, and correlation analysis, were conducted. The study reveals students’ motivations for programming, their attitudes towards AI-driven educational tools, and the perceived impact on equity, diversity, and inclusion. Significant variations were found in attitudes based on educational level and country of residence, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to enhance the inclusivity and effectiveness of AI-driven programming education tools. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) have allowed for new and creative ways of leveraging AI to support K12 students' collaborative learning in STEM+C domains. To date, there is little evidence of AI methods supporting students' collaboration in complex, open-ended environments. AI systems are known to underperform humans in (1) interpreting students' emotions in learning contexts, (2) grasping the nuances of social interactions and (3) understanding domain-specific information that was not well-represented in the training data. As such, combined human and AI (ie, hybrid) approaches are needed to overcome the current limitations of AI systems. In this paper, we take a first step towards investigating how a human-AI collaboration between teachers and researchers using an AI-generated multimodal timeline can guide and support teachers' feedback while addressing students' STEM+C difficulties as they work collaboratively to build computational models and solve problems. In doing so, we present a framework characterizing the human component of our human-AI partnership as a collaboration between teachers and researchers. To evaluate our approach, we present our timeline to a high school teacher and discuss the key insights gleaned from our discussions. Our case study analysis reveals the effectiveness of an iterative approach to using human-AI collaboration to address students' STEM+C challenges: the teacher can use the AI-generated timeline to guide formative feedback for students, and the researchers can leverage the teacher's feedback to help improve the multimodal timeline. Additionally, we characterize our findings with respect to two events of interest to the teacher: (1) when the students cross a difficulty threshold, and (2) the point of intervention, that is, when the teacher (or system) should intervene to provide effective feedback. It is important to note that the teacher explained that there should be a lag between (1) and (2) to give students a chance to resolve their own difficulties. Typically, such a lag is not implemented in computer-based learning environments that provide feedback. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Collaborative, open-ended learning environments enhance students' STEM+C conceptual understanding and practice, but they introduce additional complexities when students learn concepts spanning multiple domains. Recent advances in generative AI and MMLA allow for integrating multiple datastreams to derive holistic views of students' states, which can support more informed feedback mechanisms to address students' difficulties in complex STEM+C environments. Hybrid human-AI approaches can help address collaborating students' STEM+C difficulties by combining the domain knowledge, emotional intelligence and social awareness of human experts with the general knowledge and efficiency of AI. What this paper adds We extend a previous human-AI collaboration framework using a hybrid intelligence approach to characterize the human component of the partnership as a researcher-teacher partnership and present our approach as a teacher-researcher-AI collaboration. We adapt an AI-generated multimodal timeline to actualize our human-AI collaboration by pairing the timeline with videos of students encountering difficulties, engaging in active discussions with a high school teacher while watching the videos to discern the timeline's utility in the classroom. From our discussions with the teacher, we define two types of inflection points to address students' STEM+C difficulties—the difficulty threshold and the intervention point—and discuss how the feedback latency interval separating them can inform educator interventions. We discuss two ways in which our teacher-researcher-AI collaboration can help teachers support students encountering STEM+C difficulties: (1) teachers using the multimodal timeline to guide feedback for students, and (2) researchers using teachers' input to iteratively refine the multimodal timeline. Implications for practice and/or policy Our case study suggests that timeline gaps (ie, disengaged behaviour identified by off-screen students, pauses in discourse and lulls in environment actions) are particularly important for identifying inflection points and formulating formative feedback. Human-AI collaboration exists on a dynamic spectrum and requires varying degrees of human control and AI automation depending on the context of the learning task and students' work in the environment. Our analysis of this human-AI collaboration using a multimodal timeline can be extended in the future to support students and teachers in additional ways, for example, designing pedagogical agents that interact directly with students, developing intervention and reflection tools for teachers, helping teachers craft daily lesson plans and aiding teachers and administrators in designing curricula. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - With the recent advancement in technology, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can produce hyper-realistic multimedia content, such as audio, text, images, and videos. Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners' retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its humanlike qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The automatic generation of hints by Large Language Models (LLMs) within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) has shown potential to enhance student learning. However, generating pedagogically sound hints that address student misconceptions and adhere to specific educational objectives remains challenging. This work explores using LLMs (GPT-4o and Llama-3-8B-instruct) as teachers to generate effective hints for students simulated through LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, or Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3) tackling math exercises designed for human high-school students, and designed using cognitive science principles. We present here the study of several dimensions: 1) identifying error patterns made by simulated students on secondary-level math exercises; 2) developing various prompts for GPT-4o as a teacher and evaluating their effectiveness in generating hints that enable simulated students to self-correct; and 3) testing the best-performing prompts, based on their ability to produce relevant hints and facilitate error correction, with Llama-3-8BInstruct as the teacher, allowing for a performance comparison with GPT-4o. The results show that model errors increase with higher temperature settings. Notably, when hints are generated by GPT-4o, the most effective prompts include prompts tailored to specific errors as well as prompts providing general hints based on common mathematical errors. Interestingly, Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a teacher showed better overall performance than GPT-4o. Also the problem-solving and response revision capabilities of the LLMs as students, particularly GPT-3.5-turbo, improved significantly after receiving hints, especially at lower temperature settings. However, models like Mistral-7B-Instruct demonstrated a decline in performance as the temperature increased. This study advances our understanding of the potential and limitations of LLMs in educational contexts, towards integrating these models into pedagogically grounded. © 2024 J.C. Tonga, B.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the need to teach artificial intelli- gence (AI) and machine learning (ML) at the school level. This push acknowledges the meteoric growth in the range and diversity of ap- plications of ML in all industries and everyday consumer products, with Large Language Models (LLMs) being only the latest and most compelling example yet. Efforts to bring AI, especially ML educa- tion to school learners are being propelled by substantial industry interest, research efforts, as well as technological developments that make sophisticated ML tools readily available to learners of all ages. These early efforts span a variety of learning goals captured by the AI4K12 "big ideas"framework and employ a plurality of pedagogies.This paper provides a sense for the current state of the field, shares lessons learned from early K-12 AI education as well as CS education efforts that can be leveraged, highlights issues that must be addressed in designing for teaching AI in K-12, and provides guidance for future K-12 AI education efforts and tackle what to many feels like "the next new thing".  © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Purpose: The primary objective of this article is to answer the proposed research questions by analyzing the publications on artificial intelligence (AI), education, business, and conversational agents (CAs) or chatbots within the Scopus database to identify the most frequent terms used by scholars over the years, as well as to classify the research evolution based on the most important thematic trends. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by offering insights into the thematic landscape of AI-related research across multiple domains. By employing a comprehensive methodology, the article provides a nuanced understanding of the intersection between AI, education, business, and CAs. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology comprises two main components. Firstly, topic modeling is applied by the year of publication to summaries of articles meeting the search criteria. Secondly, grounded theory coding was used to categorize generated themes into more meaningful classifications. This dual approach ensures a rigorous data analysis and facilitates the identification of overarching thematic trends. Findings: The results reveal five thematic trends investigated in the analyzed publications: 1. student-centered learning in higher education; 2. interactive methods using the natural language processing (NLP) approach; 3. technological solutions and ChatGPT in a university context; 4. enhancing education through intelligent platforms; and 5. challenges for social and academic integration of AI tools. Additionally, the study proposes a research agenda with some questions as future avenues of inquiry. © 2024 Mackenzie Presbyterian University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Robots have become increasingly important in a variety of life domains as a result of the rapid advancement of technology. Additionally, robots are employed in education as teaching assistants in science, art, and language courses. This research aims to explore the potential of robotic systems as a multipurpose tool for increasing cultural awareness, language proficiency, and communicative competence in the GenAI era. Language games, conversation simulations, and real-time feedback mechanisms are just a few examples of interactive scenarios enabled by virtual robot systems or tutor robots that enable immersive language experiences that go beyond the limitations of conventional schooling. This research contributes knowledge that explores how AI can be used to personalize language teaching according to the needs and learning styles of each student in higher education. The total population of undergraduate students involved in this research was 350 for the 2023 academic year, with 24 students selected purposefully based on sample characteristics from this group who were exposed to using AI for one semester. The research method used is a mix method with quantitative analysis of the results of surveys and interviews with students who are known to have given positive responses and proposes a comprehensive strategy for using AI robot technology in EFL classrooms, which can significantly improve effective learning outcomes. The survey results also show that if educators have a solid understanding of the relationship between linguistic acquisition and technological advances, they will be better prepared to design engaging, individualized lessons that prepare their students to use the language effectively in real-world contexts. The robot-assisted language learning (RALL) approach used in this study, with the integration of robots in the classroom, has the potential to change the way people learn languages to make it more interesting, fun, and motivating, increase engagement efficiently, increase students’ ability to communicate across countries, and equip them to thrive in a globalized world. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Pedagogical agents (PAs) communicate verbally and non-verbally with students in digital and virtual reality/augmented reality learning environments. PAs have been shown to be beneficial for learning, and generative artificial intelligence, such as large language models, can improve PAs' communication abilities significantly. K-12 education is underrepresented in learning technology research and teachers' and students' insights have not been considered when developing PA communication. The current study addresses this research gap by conducting and analyzing semi-structured, in-depth interviews with eleven high school teachers and sixteen high school students about their expectations for PAs' communication capabilities. The interviewees identified relational and task-related communication capabilities that a PA should perform to communicate effectively with students and scaffold their learning. PA communication that is simultaneously affirmative and relational can induce immediacy, foster the relationship and engagement with a PA, and support students' learning management. Additionally, the teachers and students described the activities and technological aspects that should be considered when designing conversational PAs. The study showed that teachers and students applied human-to-human communication scripts when outlining their desired PA communication characteristics. The study offers novel insights and recommendations to researchers and developers on the communicational, pedagogical, and technological aspects that must be considered when designing communicative PAs that scaffold students’ learning, and discusses the contributions on human–machine communication in education. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the mainstream and the impending need for an AI-trained workforce, we must devise strategies to lower the entry barrier to AI education. Advanced mathematical preparation and computational thinking skills are two major barriers in imparting a rigorous AI course at the high school level. Consequently, many existing AI-focused educational programs for high school students are basic primers and lack technical depth. In this paper, we assess two pedagogical instruments for increasing the self-efficacy of students in learning neural networks at the high school level. The first research question is whether high school students learn the basics of neural network design through scaffolded AI research projects. We also explore whether a dual advising structure with a research mentor and a communication teaching assistant enhances student's self-efficacy in computing. For both of these questions, we define key variables to quantify student mastery and their computational thinking using qualitative student feedback and student reflection using GPT-3. We provide a reproducible blueprint for using large language models in this task to assess student learning in other contexts as well. We also correlate our results with a pre- and post-course Likert survey to find significant factors that affect student self-efficacy and belonging in AI. With our course design and dual advising mentoring model, we find that students showed a significant improvement in their ability to articulate technical aspects within the AI domain and an increase in their confidence in speaking up in the AI field. Two out of the ten research projects applied AI techniques beyond classroom teachings, yielding original research contributions, and another six showcased students' capabilities in building neural networks from scratch. Our study has a strong selection bias since it focuses on top-performing students. However, the exploration of the two pedagogical instruments (scaffolding research projects and dual advising structure) aimed at high school students provides promising insights for future AI curricula design at the high school level. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.

AB  - Timely, personalized feedback is essential for students learning programming. LLM-powered tools like ChatGPT offer instant support, but reveal direct answers with code, which may hinder deep conceptual engagement. We developed CodeAid, an LLM-powered programming assistant delivering helpful, technically correct responses, without revealing code solutions. CodeAid answers conceptual questions, generates pseudo-code with line-by-line explanations, and annotates student's incorrect code with fix suggestions. We deployed CodeAid in a programming class of 700 students for a 12-week semester. A thematic analysis of 8,000 usages of CodeAid was performed, further enriched by weekly surveys, and 22 student interviews. We then interviewed eight programming educators to gain further insights. Our findings reveal four design considerations for future educational AI assistants: D1) exploiting AI's unique benefits; D2) simplifying query formulation while promoting cognitive engagement; D3) avoiding direct responses while encouraging motivated learning; and D4) maintaining transparency and control for students to asses and steer AI responses. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (genAI), it has become increasingly important to ensure that students are equipped with AI literacy to use these tools effectively and appropriately. We ran a 90-minute, optional workshop for students to demonstrate how to use genAI in the assessment process appropriately. By the end of the workshop, participants felt significantly more confident in using genAI, had more intentions to use genAI, and understood the University’s genAI policy better. The types of genAI use that participants envisioned shifted from general academic and life uses to specific, acceptable uses for learning. Students could identify some methods for assessing the output of genAI. However, it is suggested that this skill needs more development. © 2024.

AB  - Teachers skilled in using generative artificial intelligence (GAI) have advantages in terms of increased productivity and augmented instructional capabilities. Alongside the rapid advancement of GAI, teachers require authentic learning opportunities to build the confidence and expertise necessary for engaging with these technologies creatively and responsibly. This article provides an illustrative case of preparing preservice and in-service teachers with the knowledge, skills, and mindsets to teach and create with GAI. Using a self-study method to investigate professional practices, we analyzed the curriculum, instruction, and assessment in an upper-level undergraduate course in multimedia design and production. Thirty-five teachers engaged in experiential activities focussed on developing artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, alongside a collaborative assignment to co-author an open-access textbook, Teaching and Creating With Generative Artificial Intelligence. To support equitable and inclusive access to the educational benefits offered by AI, the Student Artificial Intelligence Literacy (SAIL) framework was developed. SAIL facilitates student AI literacy through curriculum engagement and three distinct types of interactions: cognitive, socio-emotional, and instructor-guided. Building on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the issues with technology training for teachers in Canada, five recommendations are offered to facilitate the meaningful integration of AI literacy in teacher education programs. © 2024 Paula MacDowell, Kristin Moskalyk, Katrina Korchinski, Dirk Morrison.

AB  - Attention is a critical factor in effective learning, particularly for first-year undergraduate students adapting to the demands of higher education. However, maintaining consistent focus poses a challenge, often exacerbated by increased digital distractions and cognitive overload. Education could be revolutionized by artificial intelligence (AI) by becoming more individualized, effective, and accessible. AI has the potential to significantly enhance teaching and learning in the educational system through a variety of tools and applications, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), Chatbots, Virtual Assistants, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Personalized Learning Platforms. This study explores the prospective applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance and sustain attention among first-year undergraduates in the educational sector. The study aims to identify specific AI solutions that monitor engagement, provide real-time feedback, and adapt content based on individual attention needs, ultimately improving students' academic performance and overall learning experience. Through a quantitative methods approach involving surveys, user testing, and data analysis, this research seeks to provide insights into the effectiveness of AI tools in fostering student focus. Findings from this study will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on AI's role in education, offering practical recommendations for institutions looking to integrate AI-based solutions to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes, particularly at the critical first-year level. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2024.

AB  - Providing personalized assistance at scale is a long-standing challenge for computing educators, but a new generation of tools powered by large language models (LLMs) offers immense promise. Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students' use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course (n = 52), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) has been integrated into foreign language (FL) education, learners' well-being is influenced by various factors, including technological, personal and contextual elements. However, few studies explored how external and internal factors jointly shape FL learners' well-being in the era of generative AI. To fill this gap, this study explores the effects of generative AI acceptance, perceived teachers' enthusiasm and self-efficacy on FL learners' well-being by investigating 613 university learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). The structural equation modelling results reveal that (1) generative AI acceptance positively predicts EFL learners' well-being and self-efficacy; (2) perceived teachers' enthusiasm does not predict learners' well-being and positively predicts EFL learners' self-efficacy; and (3) the self-efficacy for receptive skills mediates the relationship between generative AI acceptance/perceived teachers' enthusiasm and EFL learners' well-being, whereas self-efficacy for productive skills does not play the mediation role. This research broadens the understanding of the antecedents of EFL learners' well-being and extends the application of self-efficacy theory in the AI-driven educational environment, providing significant pedagogical implications. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a qualitative, high-quality State-of-the-Art (SotA) extended literature review on integrating ChatGPT, an advanced and contemporary natural language processing model, a sophisticated AI-powered chatbot that OpenAI developed in higher education. Snyder (2019, p.1) emphasised that "a literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever”. According to Barry et al (2022, p. 663), "the fundamental purpose of SotA literature review is to create a 3-part argument about the state of knowledge for a specific phenomenon: This is where we are now. This is how we got here. This is where we could go next”. This 3-part argument will underpin this study. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to transform various sectors, including education, integrating AI-powered tools like ChatGPT to enhance teaching and learning has become a topic of significant interest. This study explores the diverse applications of ChatGPT in higher education, including pedagogical practices, student engagement, intelligent tutoring systems, personalised learning, language learning support, academic research, feedback, grading, and administrative support. Additionally, it identifies the challenges and ethical concerns this technology poses, focusing on bias, privacy, data security, reliability, accountability, accuracy and the balance between human interaction and artificial intelligence. Analysing the literature on ChatGPT’s role in higher education presents future directions for implementing it in higher education settings, ushering in an era of exciting possibilities. The research concludes that higher education institutions should provide clear and transparent guidelines for their staff and students on using ChatGPT responsibly for academic purposes to mitigate any ethical concerns. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited.

AB  - Purpose: In 2022 generative AI took the Internet world by storm. Free access to tools that can generate text and images that pass for human creations triggered fiery debates about the potential uses and misuses of generative AI in education. There has risen a need to check the popular utopian and dystopian narratives about AI against the diversity of hopes, concerns and future imaginaries that educators themselves associate with generative AI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perspectives of Finnish teacher educators on the use of AI in education. Design/methodology/approach: This article reports findings from a hands-on workshop in teacher training, where participants learned about how generative AI works, collaboratively explored generative AI and then reflected on its potential and challenges. Findings: The results reveal nuanced, calm and thoughtful imaginaries rooted in deep understanding of educational policy, evaluation and the sociocultural context of education. The results cover teachers’ views on the impact of AI on learners’ agency, metacognition, self-regulation and more. Originality/value: This article offers a unique exploration into the perceptions and imaginaries of educators regarding generative AI in specific (instead of “monolithic AI”), moving beyond dystopian views and instead focusing on the potential of AI to align with existing pedagogical practices. The educators contrasted the common techno-deterministic narratives and perceived AI as an avenue to support formative assessment practices and development of metacognition, self-regulation, responsibility and well-being. The novel insights also include the need for AI education that critically incorporates social and ethical viewpoints and fosters visions for a future with culturally, socially and environmentally sustainable AI. © 2024, Henriikka Vartiainen, Teemu Valtonen, Juho Kahila and Matti Tedre.

AB  - This study explores the impact of ChatGPT, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM), as a virtual tutor in online education across five key dimensions: answering questions, writing assistance, study resources, exam preparation, and availability. Utilizing an experimental design, 68 undergraduate students from a public university interacted with ChatGPT over a 15-week academic semester. Data were collected through a validated questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple regression. Findings reveal that students generally perceive ChatGPT as a valuable tool, with a high mean rating across dimensions such as exam preparation (M = 3.38, SD = 1.26) and availability (M = 3.55, SD = 1.34). The correlation analyses showed significant interdependencies between dimensions, with the highest correlation coefficient observed between writing assistance and exam preparation (Kendall’s tau_b = 0.45, p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis identified writing assistance (β = 0.35, p < 0.01) and exam preparation (β = 0.40, p < 0.01) as significant predictors of overall effectiveness. These findings suggest that ChatGPT’s multiple functionalities do not operate independently but instead complement and reinforce each other, resulting in a more supportive and integrated learning environment. The study's findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs to address the limitations of traditional Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and offer a more comprehensive and personalized approach to online learning support. The study, however, identifies key areas for enhancing the LLM-based learning environment including the need for greater contextual engagement in learning materials and more comprehensive and personalized feedback mechanisms. The implications of these findings and future research directions are further discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is prevalent in everyday life, with emerging technologies like AI companions, autonomous vehicles, and AI art tools poised to significantly transform the future. The development of AI curricula that shows people how AI works and what they can do with it is a powerful way to prepare everyone, and especially young learners, for an increasingly AI-driven world. Educators often employ robotic toolkits in the classroom to boost engagement and learning. However, these platforms are generally unsuitable for young learners and learners without programming expertise. Moreover, these platforms often serve as either programmable artifacts or pedagogical agents, rarely capitalizing on the opportunity to support students in both capacities. We designed Doodlebot, a mobile social robot for hands-on AI education to address these gaps. Doodlebot is an effective tool for exploring AI with grade school (K-12) students, promoting their understanding of AI concepts such as perception, representation, reasoning and generation. We begin by elaborating Doodlebot's design, highlighting its reliability, user-friendliness, and versatility. Then, we demonstrate Doodlebot's versatility through example curricula about AI character design, autonomous robotics, and generative AI accessible to young learners. Finally, we share the results of a preliminary user study with elementary school youth where we found that the physical Doodlebot platform was as effective and user-friendly as the virtual version. This work offers insights into designing interactive educational robots that can inform future AI curricula and tools. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have found several use cases in education, ranging from automatic question generation to essay evaluation. In this paper, we explore the potential of using LLMs to author Intelligent Tutoring Systems. A common pitfall of using LLMs as tutors is their straying from desired pedagogical strategies such as leaking the answer to the student, and in general, providing no guarantees on the validity or appropriateness of the tutor assistance. We argue that while LLMs with certain guardrails can take the place of subject experts, the overall pedagogical design still needs to be handcrafted for the best learning results. Based on this principle, we create a sample end-to-end tutoring system named MWPTutor, which uses LLMs to fill in the state space of a predefined finite state transducer. This approach retains the structure and the pedagogy of traditional tutoring systems that has been developed over the years by learning scientists but brings in additional flexibility of LLM-based approaches. Through a human evaluation study on two datasets with math word problems, we show that our hybrid approach achieves a better overall tutoring score than an instructed, but otherwise free-form, GPT-4. MWPTutor is completely modular and opens up the scope for the community to improve its performance by refining its individual modules or using different teaching strategies that it can follow. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - In the digital era, Artificial Intelligence is increasingly developing. In recent years, one of the promising development in this field is ChatGPT which has sparked considerable interest. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that allows people to interact with a computer in a more natural and conversational way. It offers students and educators personalized learning experiences Linked to ChatGPt open AI API. Therefore, we present in this paper a virtual tutor, named NAJEH, integrated into the student engagement portal and mobile application (MYU) and have access to the Student Information System (SIS) and Learning Management System (LMS) of the Honoris United Universities11https://honoris.net/, which includes 6 institutions in Tunisia. Around five thousand students from the Université Centrale had the learning experience with NAJEH. A survey was carried out in order to explore students satisfaction and acceptance of NAJEH. Thus, with a 76% response rate, results show that more than 80 % of students find this chatbot tutor very useful, easy and use it at least once a day. As perspective, we propose to investigate on the impact of these interactions on the students' academic performance and teaching efficiency. In fact, an in-depth study requires more data available over a longer period, even several years. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way programming is taught and learnt and is redefining t he way programming skills are assessed in the continuously changing field of computer science education. This paper introduces a novel approach for teaching and evaluating programming knowledge by reversing Bloom's taxonomy in order to accommodate AI-powered learning. Traditionally, Bloom's taxonomy progresses from basic cognitive skills like remembering and understanding to advanced skills like creating. With AI tools such as WebSim.ai and Anthropic Artifacts now capable of generating sophisticated outputs, the focus shifts away from students' ability to create, as these tools handle that task effectively. Instead, this paper proposes placing a higher emphasis on students' ability to understand and critically analyze AI -generated solutions, assessing their comprehension and ability to reverse-engineer existing work. We call this the Reverse Bloom Taxonomy, where students begin with creation and then move toward deeper understanding of the subject matter. This paper outlines the methodology for applying this reversed framework in programming education and presents a promising concept for improving student learning outcomes. The discussion addresses challenges in implementation and emphasizes the strategic integration of AI -driven learning to prepare students for a technology-driven workforce. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) includes complex concepts and could be difficult for non-computer or information students, and they may experience difficulties in an AI course. In order to develop students' AI skills, regulate their academic stress, and reduce student loneliness, the researchers in this study integrated self-regulation scaffolding (supported by a chatbot designed in this study) with online collaborative reflection, and investigated their effects on students' learning. The researchers conducted a quasi-experiment to explore the effects of self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection. The participants in this experiment were 116 undergraduates from three classes (groups) of a non-computer department taking a compulsory course titled ‘Introduction to Artificial Intelligence’. The experimental groups in this study included the first class (G1) simultaneously receiving the interventions of self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection, as well as the second class (G2) only receiving the intervention of self-regulation scaffolding. The last class (G3), that received a traditional teaching method (non-self-regulation scaffolding and non-online collaborative reflection) in an online AI course, served as the control group. According to the statistical analysis in this study, the self-regulation scaffolding approach in G2 significantly promoted participants' AI skills and fostered their ability to regulate academic stress compared to the control group. However, G1 students who received concurrent online collaborative reflection did not demonstrate the expected effects of enhancing their learning compared with those (G2) who did not receive it. This study represents an early attempt to implement self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection integrated with chatbot in an online AI course. The results of this study could serve as a reference for online course designers, educators, and scholars planning to adopt these teaching methods, especially for those focusing on implementing online AI education and educational technologies (such as chatBot). © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Amalgamating generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), Bloom’s taxonomy and critical thinking present a promising avenue to revolutionize assessment pedagogy and foster higher-order cognitive skills needed for learning autonomy in the domain of self-directed learning. Gen AI, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a frontrunner in creative tasks, revolutionizing various domains such as art, music, writing and design and showcasing its ability to generate original content across various domains, including education. Incorporating social, cultural, economic and pedagogical dimensions, AI in education encompasses the incorporation of AI technologies like intelligent tutoring systems, chatbots, robots, learning analytics dashboards, adaptive learning systems and automated assessment to bolster and elevate the educational process. The significance of the impact on the creativity component of Krathwohl’s revised Bloom’s taxonomy arises from the utilization of Gen AI in creative tasks, which prompts concerns regarding the authenticity and originality of AI-generated content. This conceptual research study seeks to investigate the affordances of this amalgamation and aims to reframe the higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy to enhance critical thinking and self-directed learning among students. This study grounds the reader in the existing literature and sets a course for where research in this field should be heading, thus adding value, rather than only providing an overview of the literature. The overall aim of this research was to explore the affordances of the amalgamation of AI, Bloom’s taxonomy and critical thinking to support assessment pedagogy for self-directed learning. This paper identifies the gap in the current literature about reconceptualizing assessment pedagogy for developing higher-order thinking skills in a Gen AI higher education landscape. This paper presents a case of revisiting Bloom’s taxonomy, advocating the importance of AI fluency and assessment literacy for the development of critical thinking skills and self-directed learning. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Writing proficiency is an essential skill for upper secondary students that can be enhanced through effective feedback. Creating feedback on writing tasks, however, is time-intensive and presents a challenge for educators, often resulting in students receiving insufficient or no feedback. The advent of text-generating large language models (LLMs) offers a promising solution, namely, automated evidence-based feedback generation. Yet, empirical evidence from randomized controlled studies about the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback is missing. To address this issue, the current study compared the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback to no feedback. A sample of N = 459 upper secondary students of English as a foreign language wrote an argumentative essay. Students in the experimental group were asked to revise their text according to feedback that was generated using the LLM GPT-3.5-turbo. The control group revised their essays without receiving feedback. We assessed improvement in the revision using automated essay scoring. The results showed that LLM-generated feedback increased revision performance (d =.19) and task motivation (d = 0.36). Moreover, it increased positive emotions (d = 0.34) compared to revising without feedback. The findings highlight that using LLMs allows to create timely feedback that can positively relate to students’ cognitive and affective-motivational outcomes. Future perspectives and the implications for research and practice of using LLM-generated feedback in intelligent tutoring systems are discussed. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems require student modeling in order to make pedagogical decisions, such as individualized feedback or task selection. Typically, student modeling is based on the eventual correctness of tasks. However, for multi-step or iterative learning tasks, like in programming, the intermediate states towards a correct solution also carry crucial information about learner skill. We investigate how to detect learners who struggle on their path towards a correct solution of a task. Prior work addressed struggle detection in programming environments on different granularity levels, but has mostly focused on preventing course dropout. We conducted a pilot study of our programming learning environment and evaluated different approaches for struggle detection at the task level. For the evaluation of measures, we use downstream Item Response Theory competency models. We find that detecting struggle based on large language model text embeddings outperforms chosen baselines with regard to correlation with a programming competency proxy. © 2024 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

AB  - Conversational AI (C-AI), like OpenAI's ChatGPT [38] or Google's Gemini [1], has seen a surge in development in recent years, driven by advancements in large language models. C-AI has the unique capability to instantaneously communicate with others using vast and contextual knowledge, providing personalized assistance tailored to individual needs. While the specific applications and advantages of conversational technologies are still being explored, prior research has noted the potential for conversational agents to serve in pedagogical settings, such as teaching agents, collaborative partners, or motivational tools [13,30]. The successful development and implementation of pedagogical C-AI relies on an understanding of learners' perceptions, trust, and overall acceptance of C-AI. There is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing learners' trust and acceptance of this emerging technology. Grounded in the theories proposed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [16], the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [47], and Mayer, Davis and Schoorman's model of organizational trust [35], this paper proposes a model of learners' acceptance and trust for C-AI. The proposed model integrates factors relating to learners' perceptions and trust of C-AI, and additionally, four groups of moderating variables (e.g. individual characteristics). The proposed model hypothesizes that learners' perceptions and trust significantly influence their acceptance and behavioral intention to use C-AI. The relationships between learners' perceptions, trust, and acceptance are additionally proposed to be influenced by four groups of moderating variables: individual characteristics, AI characteristics, facilitating conditions, and subjective norms. To validate the proposed model, we plan to collect survey data and leverage structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. We will specifically evaluate the fitness of the proposed model through chi-square tests, RMSEA, CFI, and SRMR metrics. This study can provide valuable insights toward the scalable adoption and usage of C-AI in learning environments. Understanding the structural relationships between the factors that influence learners' acceptance and trust of pedagogical C-AI will be crucial for designing and deploying these technologies in ways that foster learners' engagement, self-efficacy, academic interest, and ultimately lead to positive learning outcomes. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - The broad approach to using Generative AI in K-12 schooling focuses on identifying risks and productivity gains rather than the more complex issues of transformational change. As a response, this study examined how school leaders considered Gen AI transformation within their disciplines. Ten subject leaders were interviewed about their pedagogical beliefs for Gen AI. A belief framework underpinned this study to examine more deeply teachers’ multidimensional belief systems that direct transformative Gen AI practices in their classroom. The findings indicate that subversive beliefs about Gen AI limit and influence classroom practice; productivity had little influence on pedagogical roles for Gen AI; and each teacher evidenced a different belief system that represented inter-relationships between risk, productivity and transformation which informed discipline-specific classroom Gen AI approaches. This study contributes teachers’ pedagogical belief systems for Gen AI use and pedagogical approaches to Gen AI on a continuum towards transformative practice. © 2024 Technology, Pedagogy and Education Association.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are poised to have a profound impact on medical education. Medical students, as early adopters of technology and future health care providers, play a crucial role in shaping the future of health care. However, little is known about the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use AI chatbots among medical students in China. Objective: This study aims to explore the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use generative AI chatbots among medical students in China, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. By conducting a national cross-sectional survey, we sought to identify the key determinants that influence medical students’ acceptance of AI chatbots, thereby providing a basis for enhancing their integration into medical education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators, policy makers, and technology developers to design and implement effective AI-driven educational tools that align with the needs and expectations of future health care professionals. Methods: A web-based electronic survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via social media to medical students across the country. The UTAUT was used as a theoretical framework to design the questionnaire and analyze the data. The relationship between behavioral intention to use AI chatbots and UTAUT predictors was examined using multivariable regression. Results: A total of 693 participants were from 57 universities covering 21 provinces or municipalities in China. Only a minority (199/693, 28.72%) reported using AI chatbots for studying, with ChatGPT (129/693, 18.61%) being the most commonly used. Most of the participants used AI chatbots for quickly obtaining medical information and knowledge (631/693, 91.05%) and increasing learning efficiency (594/693, 85.71%). Utilization behavior, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, and personal innovativeness showed significant positive associations with the behavioral intention to use AI chatbots (all P values were <.05). Conclusions: Chinese medical students hold positive perceptions toward and high intentions to use AI chatbots, but there are gaps between intention and actual adoption. This highlights the need for strategies to improve access, training, and support and provide peer usage examples to fully harness the potential benefits of chatbot technology. © Wenjuan Tao, Jinming Yang, Xing Qu.

AB  - Following the launch of the generative AI Web application, Ask.SMILE, designed to evaluate the cognitive levels of questions asked, 2559 educators generated 25,973 question-feedback sets over a three-month period, with an average of over 10 questions per participant. Analyses revealed a significant improvement in question quality from initial submissions to later stages. Specifically, participants progressed from Level 1 questions (simple recall) to Level 5 questions (creative and evaluative), based on Bloom’s Taxonomy. However, participants who began with lower-quality questions showed varied progression paths to higher levels. To analyze the data, a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) was used to account for both fixed and random effects, revealing a statistically significant improvement in question quality over time (p <.01). ANOVA results further confirmed the significance of question stage on quality, and a Least Squares Means (LSMEANS) analysis indicated a precise and significant improvement in later-stage questions. Additionally, survey responses highlighted participants’ appreciation for the ongoing development of AI-driven educational tools like Ask.SMILE. Several implications and future research directions are explored, including the potential to expand the platform’s features beyond question evaluation. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Chatbots can have a significant positive impact on learning. There is a growing interest in their application in teaching and learning. The self-regulation of learning is fundamental for the development of lifelong learning skills, and for this reason, education should contribute to its development. In this sense, the potential of chatbot technologies for supporting students to self-regulate their learning activity has already been pointed out. The objective of this work is to explore university students’ interactions with EDUguia chatbot to understand whether there are patterns of use linked to phases of self-regulated learning and academic task completion. This study presents an analysis of conversation pathways with a chatbot tutor to enhance self-regulation skills in higher education. Some relevant findings on the length, duration, and endpoints of the conversations are shared. In addition, patterns in these pathways and users’ interactions with the tool are analysed. Some findings are relevant to the analysis of the link between design and user experience, but they can also be related to implementation decisions. The findings presented could contribute to the work of other educators, designers, and developers interested in developing a tool addressing this goal. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The pervasive and rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) necessitates a fundamental AI understanding for all individuals. AI's dynamic nature often makes it challenging even for technical people to stay continuously updated on AI, making it especially essential for professionals in leading positions, regardless of their technical background. Understanding AI equips leaders to make knowledgeable decisions about AI's responsible adoption in their workplace, address its ethical implications, and enable better communication about AI initiatives within the organization. It also demystifies the technology, and ensures leaders can responsibly navigate AI-driven changes. Most AI-related courses mainly focus on teaching programming languages and handling big data. A closer look at AI adult education reveals gaps and limitations in content suitable for professional adults - e.g in leadership, decision-making, ethics, governance and cultural aspects of organizational change. Furthermore, AI education pedagogy for adult learners,is still understudied. Literature suggests that adults are self-directed, experience-based learners. Therefore, their learning should involve self-planning, experiential learning, collaborative environments, and real-world applications. Notably, current AI education platforms lack sufficient focus on these areas. While efforts are being taken to address these issues, more adult education programs need to be specifically designed for the training needs of leadership in AI. This research investigates the efficacy and outcomes of an AI education workshop, uniquely designed for large scale organization leaders, employing hands-on projects, collaborative learning, and problem-solving scenarios grounded in real-world applications, that considers technical, ethical, policy and organizational culture dimensions. The workshop incorporates experiential learning methods, case studies, problem-based learning, and group projects. This research also analyzes how adult learners interactively learn, reflect, and apply their AI knowledge to examples drawn from their workplace, while improving their understanding and readiness to implement AI technologies effectively. Our three-day workshop centered around enriching and engaging learning about AI technologies, ethics, and leadership, featuring topics like supervised learning and bias, AI strategy, and generative AI. Apart from discussions, the workshops incorporated hands-on learning with digital tools, robots, problem-solving scenarios, and a capstone project. Participants were 44 leaders from a large government organization. Their learning was measured through pre- and post-questionnaires on AI leadership, knowledge checks on workshop content, and group interviews post-event. Results indicated a substantial increase in the participants' AI knowledge, emphasizing the workshop's efficacy in enhancing AI literacy, expanding human-AI collaboration, and ethical understanding. The satisfaction survey showed the workshop was enjoyable and substantially improved learners' understanding of AI and its applications. Learners praised the emphasis on people and ethics in AI and how it inspired them to drive change. They, however, wanted more preparation time and support for understanding content. The capstone project offered an effective hands-on experience that fostered learning and teamwork. Some technical problems were reported, negatively impacting engagement levels. Current research findings are guiding future workshop iterations. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.

AB  - Games have been successfully used to provide engaging health interventions for adolescents. However, translating health education goals into a playable game has historically taken many person-months of effort, involving game designers, scriptwriters, and artists. This work presents an exploratory study into rapidly developing physician-validated health education games for adolescents using virtual agents and LLMs. We evaluated this approach in an intervention to promote Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among adolescents, as lack of knowledge and vaccine hesitancy contribute to suboptimal HPV vaccination rates. We conducted a between-subjects randomized study comparing a fantasy narrative game to a non-gamified pedagogical virtual agent, with both interventions conveying the same HPV information. Among our study's 9-12-year-old adolescent participants, our findings demonstrate large pre-to-post improvements in HPV knowledge for both conditions. The gamified intervention showed higher engagement and entertainment than the pedagogical agent based on participant interviews, demonstrating that gamification enriched the educational experience for adolescents. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - LLM-based chatbots enable students to get immediate, interactive help on homework assignments, but even a thoughtfully-designed bot may not serve all pedagogical goals. We report here on the development and deployment of a GPT-4-based interactive homework assistant (“61A Bot”) for students in a large CS1 course; over 2000 students made over 100,000 requests of our Bot across two semesters. Our assistant offers one-shot, contextual feedback within the command-line “autograder” students use to test their code. Our Bot wraps student code in a custom prompt that supports our pedagogical goals and avoids providing solutions directly. Analyzing student feedback, questions, and autograder data, we find reductions in homework-related question rates in our course forum, as well as reductions in homework completion time when our Bot is available. For students in the 50tℎ − 80tℎ percentile, reductions can exceed 30 minutes per assignment, up to 50% less time than students at the same percentile rank in prior semesters. Finally, we discuss these observations, potential impacts on student learning, and other potential costs and benefits of AI assistance in CS1. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Learning in higher education comes with several challenges, particularly for freshmen since it requires a high degree of autonomous and self-motivated learning. Technology-supported learning already aims to address these challenges but often lacks the social component of learning. Pedagogical agents, particularly social robots can provide personalized tutoring as well as social interaction but are currently not widespread and still seen as a futuristic technology. This contribution presents a concept for applying robot-supported tutoring in higher education. The social robot is used as a tutor in a one-to-one tutoring scenario, which can be directly integrated into university courses. Our approach was intensively evaluated in the field under real conditions and gradually optimized in a total of seven studies. The robot-assisted tutoring has been highly accepted by students and participation reveals cognitive and affective benefits. The concept is not subject-specific and can be transferred to different courses. Finally, we provide guidance on how to integrate robot-supported tutoring into university classes. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Debugging is a crucial skill for programmers, yet it can be challenging for novices to learn. The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for providing personalized debugging support to students. However, concerns have been raised about potential student over-reliance on LLM-based tools. This mixed-methods study investigates how a pedagogically-designed LLM-based chatbot supports students' debugging efforts in an introductory programming course. We conducted interviews and debugging think-Aloud tasks with 20 students at three points throughout the semester. We specifically focused on characterizing when students initiate help from the chatbot during debugging, how they engage with the chatbot's responses, and how they describe their learning experiences with the chatbot. By analyzing data from the debugging tasks, we identified varying help-seeking behaviors and levels of engagement with the chatbot's responses, depending on students' familiarity with the suggested strategies. Interviews revealed that students appreciated the content and experiential knowledge provided by the chatbot, but did not view it as a primary source for learning debugging strategies. Additionally, students self-identified certain chatbot usage behaviors as negative, "non-ideal"engagement and others as positive, "learning-oriented"usage. Based on our findings, we discuss pedagogical implications and future directions for designing pedagogical chatbots to support debugging. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - We analyzed the communication patterns of Cipherbot, an educational AI chatbot that addresses validation and transparency problems in AI-student interaction, with 44 undergraduate business students using the system. Findings show that Cipherbot delivers information grounded in learning materials, primarily focusing on statements of fact, with a 99% occurrence rate. Also, about a third (31%) of Cipherbot's messages to students contain an example, which adheres to pedagogical best practices. However, more than a third (36%) of Cipherbot's communication with students also contained traces of opinion, particularly normative statements about how companies or individuals should behave. Cipherbot also demonstrates some level of social etiquette, using thank yous and apologies (7%), but it rarely engages in requests for information, or clarifications and comprehension checks-as these categories might be useful for student engagement, future exploration into diversifying Cipherbot's communication style to support learning is required. Student feedback suggests that usability issues in educational AI chatbots comprise both communicational and technical issues, e.g., incompleteness and redundancy-iterative testing of prompts with student feedback could address many of these challenges. Based on our findings, we make six propositions about students' interaction with educational AI chatbots. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are poised to become an increasingly important part of education in the anatomical sciences. OpenAI has also introduced generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), which are customizable versions of the standard ChatGPT application. There is little research that has explored the potential of GPTs to serve as intelligent tutoring systems for learning the anatomical sciences. The objective of this study was to describe the design and explore the performance of AnatomyGPT, a customized artificial intelligence application intended for anatomical sciences education. The AnatomyGPT application was configured with GPT Builder by uploading open-source textbooks as knowledge sources and by providing pedagogical instructions for how to interact with users. The performance of AnatomyGPT was compared with ChatGPT by evaluating the responses of both applications to prompts of the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) sample items with respect to accuracy, rationales, and citations. AnatomyGPT achieved high scores on the NBME sample items for Gross Anatomy, Embryology, Histology, and Neuroscience and scored comparably to ChatGPT. In addition, AnatomyGPT provided several citations in the responses that it generated, while ChatGPT provided none. Both GPTs provided rationales for all sample items. The customized AnatomyGPT application demonstrated preliminary potential as an intelligent tutoring system by generating responses with increased citations as compared with the standard ChatGPT application. The findings of this study suggest that instructors and students may wish to create their own custom GPTs for teaching and learning anatomy. Future research is needed to further develop and characterize the potential of GPTs for anatomy education. © 2024 American Association of Clinical Anatomists and British Association of Clinical Anatomists.

AB  - This paper addresses the need for a positive and effective learning environment for engineering students in non-computer science fields to grasp Generative AI principles while navigating the intricate balance between its application and developmental insights. Drawing from pedagogical theories and cognitive science, especially Leinenbach and Corey (2004)’s Universal Design for Learning, this study proposes a framework tailored to the unique needs and backgrounds of engineering students. The framework emphasizes active learning strategies, collaborative problem-solving, and real-world applications to engage learners in meaningful experiences with Generative AI concepts. The central learning context is a M.Sc. program in management engineering with a course/training opportunity in Machine Learning Fundamentals using Python based on Google Collab. The introduction of Generative AI is based on selected Google libraries for Python. Furthermore, this paper explores various instructional approaches and tools to scaffold students' understanding of Generative AI, including hands-on projects, case studies, and interactive simulations. It also addresses ethical considerations and societal implications associated with Generative AI deployment, encouraging students to critically reflect on the broader impacts of their technical decisions. Through a synthesis of pedagogical best practices and AI development principles, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on effective AI education for non-computer science disciplines. By embracing a holistic approach that integrates theory with practical application, educators can empower engineering students to harness the transformative potential of Generative AI while navigating its complexities responsibly and ethically. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.

AB  - Peer influence plays a crucial role in promoting classroom participation, where behaviors from active students can contribute to a collective classroom learning experience. However, the presence of these active students depends on several conditions and is not consistently available across all circumstances. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT have demonstrated the ability to simulate diverse human behaviors convincingly due to their capacity to generate contextually coherent responses based on their role settings. Inspired by this advancement in technology, we designed ClassMeta, a GPT-4 powered agent to help promote classroom participation by playing the role of an active student. These agents, which are embodied as 3D avatars in virtual reality, interact with actual instructors and students with both spoken language and body gestures. We conducted a comparative study to investigate the potential of ClassMeta for improving the overall learning experience of the class. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - There is growing recognition among researchers and stakeholders about the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on classroom instruction. As a crucial element in developing AI literacy, AI education in K-12 schools is increasingly gaining attention. However, most existing research on K-12 AI education relies on experiential methodologies and suffers from a lack of quantitative analysis based on extensive classroom data, hindering a comprehensive depiction of AI education's current state at these educational levels. To address this gap, this article employs the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create an intelligent analysis framework that identifies learning theories, pedagogical approaches, learning tools, and levels of AI literacy in AI classroom instruction. Compared with the results of manual analysis, analysis based on LLMs can achieve more than 90% consistency. Our findings, based on the analysis of 98 classroom instruction videos in central Chinese cities, reveal that current AI classroom instruction insufficiently foster AI literacy, with only 35.71% addressing higher-level skills such as evaluating and creating AI. AI ethics are even less commonly addressed, featured in just 5.1% of classroom instruction. We classified AI classroom instruction into three categories: conceptual (50%), heuristic (18.37%), and experimental (31.63%). Correlation analysis suggests a significant relationship between the adoption of pedagogical approaches and the development of advanced AI literacy. Specifically, integrating Project-based/Problem-based learning (PBL) with Collaborative learning appears effective in cultivating the capacity to evaluate and create AI. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is assumed to be integrated into English language teaching (ELT) for more advanced ELT methods that can result in more productive outputs. However, it is still inconclusive whether AI is integrated into ELT by all teachers. If AI is integrated, to what extent the integration was successful, and what will be the scope for integrating more AI in ELT in the future? In addition, in what way is AI integration useful to learners of the English language, and how far the integration is disruptive to the teachers? Driven by these fundamental questions, this study explores the range of AI integration in ELT at present and its scope in the future. The exploration was carried out by collecting data online from 44 relevant articles chosen, together with the opinions of AI experts from major AI developing institutes as they were presented on various digital platforms, and the data was then analyzed using the qualitative literature review method. The inferences were used to provide an overview of AI integration in ELT at the university level of English teaching, to gain a general understanding of the status of AI integration in ELT at various institutes worldwide, and to discuss the potential role and position of English language teachers in the future, given the exponential growth and expansion of AI. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - This study evaluates “I Learn with Prompt Engineering”, a self-paced, self-regulated elective course designed to equip university students with skills in prompt engineering to effectively utilize large language models (LLMs), foster self-directed learning, and enhance academic English proficiency through generative AI applications. By integrating prompt engineering concepts with generative AI tools, the course supports autonomous learning and addresses critical skill gaps in language proficiency and market-ready capabilities. The study also examines EnSmart, an AI-driven tool powered by GPT-4 and integrated into Canvas LMS, which automates academic test content generation and grading and delivers real-time, human-like feedback. Performance evaluation, structured questionnaires, and surveys were used to evaluate the course’s impact on prompting skills, academic English proficiency, and overall learning experiences. Results demonstrated significant improvements in prompt engineering skills, with accessible patterns like “Persona” proving highly effective, while advanced patterns such as “Flipped Interaction” posed challenges. Gains in academic English were most notable among students with lower initial proficiency, though engagement and practice time varied. Students valued EnSmart’s intuitive integration and grading accuracy but identified limitations in question diversity and adaptability. The high final success rate demonstrated that proper course design (taking into consideration Panadero’s four dimensions of self-regulated learning) can facilitate successful autonomous learning. The findings highlight generative AI’s potential to enhance autonomous learning and task automation, emphasizing the necessity of human oversight for ethical and effective implementation in education. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are flexible, personalizable, and available, which makes their use within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) appealing. However, that flexibility creates risks: inaccuracies, harmful content, and non-curricular material. Ethically deploying LLM-backed ITS systems requires designing safeguards that ensure positive experiences for students. We describe the design of a conversational system integrated into an ITS, and our experience evaluating its safety with red-teaming, an in-classroom usability test and field deployment. We present empirical data from more than 8,000 student conversations with this system, finding that GPT-3.5 rarely generates inappropriate messages. Comparatively more common is inappropriate messages from students, which prompts us to reason about safeguarding as a content moderation and classroom management problem. The student interaction behaviors we observe provide implications for designers—to focus on student inputs as a content moderation problem—and implications for researchers—to focus on subtle forms of bad content. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - One of the much-debated uses for AI, especially among writing instructors, is the potential for AI to take over the commenting and grading functions of teaching. In this paper, we describe the creation and use of AI for writing feedback in two separate but interconnected approaches: the use of the “Perfect Tutor” exercise in the classroom to teach students to conceptualize the components and priorities we bring to the writing process, and how students might struggle to make use of the same AI for feedback in a less actively guided context, or when the emphasis is not on the metacognition surrounding writing. During our examination of making bots and evaluating their feedback, we explore the limits of current AI. While emphasizing the importance of understanding the limitations, we also identify productive uses of these AI feedback bots in the college writing classroom to develop student critical thinking and writing.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a rapid transformation in higher education, prompting institutions to embrace online learning and e-learning as essential mechanisms for academic continuity. In this context, Interactive Learning Environments (ILEs), augmented with generative AI chatbots, represent a promising approach to enhancing the effectiveness of virtual education and interactive learning. This paper investigates the efficacy of an ILE integrated with ChatGPT in the context of computer networking education. A pilot experiment was conducted with three graduate students with basic IT networking background. The study examined the impact of integrating ChatGPT within the ILE on students' engagement, comprehension, and overall learning outcomes. Methodological details, including learning program design, learning outcomes assessment, ILE settings, and ChatGPT integration are presented. Results from pre- and post-assessment tests, quizzes, and students' feedback on ChatGPT's utility as a learning aid are discussed. The findings suggest a significant improvement in students' comprehension and performance following their engagement with the ILE while using ChatGPT as a support tool. Despite a few drawbacks reported by the students in terms of the interfaces' ease of use, and the timely response and appropriate content delivered by ChatGPT, they were overall satisfied with the experience. The students would recommend ChatGPT for learning purposes under certain controlled environments. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on interactive learning technologies and highlights the potential of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT to revolutionize computer networking education in the digital age. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - In the contemporary digital landscape, the exclusion of digital tools in higher education undermines the essence of learning and advancement. This research delves into the symbiotic relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and education, advocating for the integration of cutting-edge AI language learning tools like ChatGPT to keep pace with innovation. Through innovative methods of integrating generative AI language models, this study proposes a hyperaware curriculum design, fostering a revamped teaching and learning environment. It suggests that by leveraging AI, education can prioritize real-world knowledge application. Rather than viewing education as a static endpoint, this research emphasizes an ongoing process of enlightenment. We propose to situate AI in education as a crucial aspect of multiliteracy pedagogical approach. Through the theoretical lens of the four crucial dimensions of multiliteracy pedagogy by New London Group (1996) including situated practice, overt instructions, critical framing, and transformed practice we postulate each dimension in the light of interweaving it with the integration of technology. As we move towards a future heavily reliant on AI, incorporating AI language models and digital tools into education is imperative. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel approach to create a high-resolution "map"for physics learning: an "atomic"learning objectives (LOs) system designed to capture detailed cognitive processes and concepts required for problem solving in a college-level introductory physics course. Our method leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated labeling of physics questions and introduces a comprehensive set of metrics to evaluate the quality of the labeling outcomes. The atomic LO system, covering nine chapters of an introductory physics course, uses a "subject-verb-object"structure to represent specific cognitive processes. We apply this system to 131 questions from expert-curated question banks and the OpenStax University Physics textbook. Each question is labeled with 1-8 atomic LOs across three chapters. Through extensive experiments using various prompting strategies and LLMs, we compare automated LOs labeling results against human expert labeling. Our analysis reveals both the strengths and limitations of LLMs, providing insight into LLMs reasoning processes for labeling LOs and identifying areas for improvement in LOs system design. Our work contributes to the field of learning analytics by proposing a more granular approach to mapping learning objectives with questions. Our findings have significant implications for the development of intelligent tutoring systems and personalized learning pathways in STEM education, paving the way for more effective "learning GPS"systems. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and its increasing societal impacts have turned many computing educators' focus toward early education in machine learning (ML). Limited options for educational tools for teaching novice learners about the mechanisms of ML and data-driven systems presents a recognized challenge in K-12 computing education. In response, we introduce "GenAI Teachable Machine,"a visual, data-driven design platform aimed at introducing novice learners to fundamental ML concepts and workflows, particularly in the context of classifiers. Following the design science research (DSR) method, this study presents the prior recommendations, standards, codevelopment, and extensive field testing that resulted in a platform enabling young learners to express their own interest-driven ideas through codesigning and sharing personally meaningful apps. The platform improves on the design of Google's popular Teachable Machine 2 by its ability to create a standalone app by defining one or more actions to be triggered by each classifier result, and deploy that app to other devices. It also enables one to distribute the collection of training data among many users. In addition to the DSR process, this article presents findings from usability lab tests (N = 8) and 6-h classroom projects involving fourth and seventh grade children (N = 213). The results show that children who had no experience of ML were able to navigate through the workflow and turn their own ideas into concrete ML-based apps. The majority of children were able to reflect and present, in their own words, their working process using data-driven (design) thinking concepts and insights.  © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - This study addresses the challenge of maintaining an up-to-date and diverse university English resource library by proposing an advanced method that leverages deep learning and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Existing systems often struggle to efficiently integrate new, varied educational materials while balancing user satisfaction with educational effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a PSO-based multi-objective recommendation framework that incrementally updates the resource library, ensuring it remains both relevant and comprehensive. Our method begins with automated data collection from sources such as academic papers, news, and educational materials, followed by rigorous data cleaning and standardization using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. At the core of our system is a fine-tuned GPT-3 model, optimized to identify and categorize resources accurately. The multi-objective PSO algorithm then balances user satisfaction with educational value, meeting both immediate learning needs and long-term goals. Continuous user feedback further refines our approach, keeping recommendations aligned with evolving educational demands. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methods in precision, coverage, diversity, and novelty, establishing it as a robust solution for AI-driven educational resource management.  © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Despite the concerns that recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised, they undoubtedly revealed a novel potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in educational environments. Whether they are used for tutoring, in a manner similar to that of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), or to support assessment design and delivery, their impact in a learning setting is remarkable. In this paper, we propose an interactive tutoring approach, utilizing ChatGPT’s API. By exploiting ChatGPT’s programming interface, we can develop customized interactive problem-solving and tutoring sessions on specific topics of interest. The API’s versatility allows for dynamic interactions, fostering a deeper understanding of subjects taught and effective problem-solving skills. We demonstrate the application of the developed code in an applied educational setting with specific use cases. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Online learning provides an opportunity for students who are geographically and temporally constrained to access quality education. However, there are significant drawbacks to online learning, such as the lack of timely feedback for students, lack of instructor support, and lack of interaction, which creates a sense of separation between teachers and students. In recent years, a large number of researchers have confirmed the feasibility of pedagogical agents, but most of them are not intelligent enough for the task of immediate feedback. However, new technologies have emerged and large language modeling has been well developed, which excels at communicating with people. By designing a pedagogical agent based on the open-source large language model, each student can get appropriate feedback on their questions and meet their individual needs. Therefore, it is necessary to create one such pedagogical agent. In this paper, an intelligent pedagogical agent is designed in an educational video, and students can call the agent for support at any time as needed. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study aims to delineate the roles of professors at universities and explore the educational applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With rapid advancements in AI technology, there is an increasing effort to integrate AI and Educational Technology (EdTech) into educational practices, resulting in AI EdTech. Higher education institutions, particularly universities, are focused on leveraging AI EdTech to augment traditional teaching roles. Traditional educational methods often face limitations in providing personalized learning experiences, whereas AI EdTech offers promising solutions to enhance these methods and provide immersive learning opportunities for students. Currently, various universities independently pursue the implementation of AI EdTech. However, for AI EdTech to be successfully established and widely adopted in higher education, key factors such as maintenance costs and the potential for continuous development should be considered. Therefore, the standardization and development of AI EdTech systems that can be universally applied across universities are essential. In this regard, this study defines the core roles of professors and proposes developmental levels for AI professors to complement these roles. It also outlines the necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each level of AI professor development. These initiatives are expected to play a crucial role in the future standardization and research development of AI EdTech systems.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Pedagogical conversational agents (CA) support formal and informal learning to help students achieve better learning outcomes by providing information, guidance or fostering reflections. Even though the extant literature suggests that pedagogical CAs can improve learning outcomes, there exists little empirical evidence of what design features drive this effect. This study reports on an exploratory field experiment involving 31 pupils in commercial high schools and finds that students achieved better learning outcomes when preparing for their tests with a pedagogical CA than without. However, the drivers of this effect remain unclear. Neither the use frequency of the design features nor the pupils' expectations towards the CA could explain the improvement in marks. However, for the subjective perception of learning achievement, pupils' expectations was a significant predictor. These findings provide support for the use of pedagogical CAs in teaching but also highlight that the drivers of better learning outcomes still remain unknown. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

AB  - Since its debut in the field of education nearly three decades ago, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been considered a powerful tool to facilitate new paradigms for instructional design and innovative educational practice by means of intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive learning systems, educational chatbots, teaching robots, to name a few. Recent technological advances in the adjacent areas of natural language processing, machine learning, and computer graphics focusing primarily on design features that can improve their human-like qualities of naturalness and believability as human interlocutors have also amplified new application opportunities for Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) or Animated Pedagogical Agents (APAs) within the area of Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL). Although AI-powered IVAs hold the potential to improve the learning process in nearly any knowledge domain and personalize automation in teaching by embodying different roles in the learning environment, strikingly few studies have empirically attempted to assess IVAs impact on L2 learners’ academic achievement when learning English as a Foreign (EFL) so far. The present article addresses this issue via a systematic review of relevant interventionist IVA studies that were conducted in EFL settings and published within the 2015–2020 timeframe examining IVAs key affordances, major barriers in their adoption for language learning purposes, and the CALL research trends currently prevalent on the topic. Pedagogical implications for the effective implementation of IVA technology in L2 contexts are discussed and future research avenues in the area are highlighted © 2023, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are currently designed and tested in many fields to improve humans’ ability to make decisions. One of these fields is higher education. For example, AI-based chatbots (“conversational pedagogical agents”) could engage in conversations with students in order to provide timely feedback and responses to questions while the learning process is taking place and to collect data to personalize the delivery of course materials. However, many existent tools are able to perform tasks that human professionals (educators, tutors, professors) could perform, just in a timelier manner. While discussing the possible implementation of AI-based tools in our university’s educational programs, we reviewed the current literature and identified a number of capabilities that future AI solutions may feature, in order to improve higher education processes, with a focus on distance higher education. Specifically, we suggest that innovative tools could influence the methodologies by which students approach learning; facilitate connections and information attainment beyond course materials; support the communication with the professor; and, draw from motivation theories to foster learning engagement, in a personalized manner. Future research should explore high-level opportunities represented by AI for higher education, including their effects on learning outcomes and the quality of the learning experience as a whole.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have become increasingly accessible and have impacted school education in numerous ways. However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In schools, teachers’ perspectives are crucial for making sense of innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives of teachers and leaders. It used four domains–learning, teaching, assessment, and administration–as the initial framework suggested in a systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in education. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - General-purpose Language Models (LMs) bypass the need for task-specific model training by allowing textual prompts to specify a downstream task (e.g., assessment, feedback generation). One of the main benefits of using a prompt-based learning method is that it circumvents the need for supervised data and training on the downstream task. However, in high-stakes settings like education, LMs need to be evaluated rigorously on the specific downstream tasks before putting them in front of the students. Unlike traditional supervised learning models that are evaluated for a specific task, LMs are often evaluated on benchmark data and tasks that may not reflect the downstream use in education. Hence, we first present arguments for contextual evaluation of LMs. Next, we present a framework for behavior analysis - an alternative approach for model evaluation. Behavior analysis involves defining LM behaviors and designing tests (e.g., invariance to irrelevant perturbations). Using a case study of assessing science ideas in student essays, with past data from ecologically valid contexts, we illustrate how behavior analysis allowed for the identification of LM failures that are likely to go unnoticed in tests for generalization. By making the LMs more transparent for scrutiny, this study suggests a way to improve LM reliability and trustworthiness. Future studies will work with education stakeholders in translating their implicit expectations of desired model behaviors into explicitly defined tests, thereby building their agency and trust in educational AI. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is the driving force of change focusing on the needs and demands of the student. The research explores Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) for building personalised learning systems for students. The research investigates and proposes a framework for AIEd: social networking sites and chatbots, expert systems for education, intelligent mentors and agents, machine learning, personalised educational systems and virtual educational environments. These technologies help educators to develop and introduce personalised approaches to master new knowledge and develop professional competencies. The research presents a case study of AIEd implementation in education. The scholars conducted the experiment in educational establishments using artificial intelligence in the curriculum. The scholars surveyed 184 second-year students of the Institute of Pedagogy and Psychology at the Abay Kazakh National Pedagogical University and the Kuban State Technological University to collect the data. The scholars considered the collective group discussions regarding the application of artificial intelligence in education to improve the effectiveness of learning. The research identified key advantages to creating personalised learning pathways such as access to training in 24/7 mode, training in virtual contexts, adaptation of educational content to personal needs of students, real-time and regular feedback, improvements in the educational process and mental stimulations. The proposed education paradigm reflects the increasing role of artificial intelligence in socio-economic life, the social and ethical concerns artificial intelligence may pose to humanity and its role in the digitalisation of education. The current article may be used as a theoretical framework for many educational institutions planning to exploit the capabilities of artificial intelligence in their adaptation to personalized learning. © The Authors.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that imitate human tutors and aim to provide immediate and customized instructions or feedback to learners have shown their effectiveness in education. With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) further entitle the systems to complex and coherent conversational interactions. These systems would be of great help in language education as it involves developing skills in communication, which, however, drew relatively less attention. Additionally, due to the complicated cognitive development at younger ages, more endeavors are needed for practical uses. Scaffolding refers to a teaching technique where teachers provide support and guidance to students for learning and developing new concepts or skills. It is an effective way to support diverse learning needs, goals, processes, and outcomes. In this work, we investigate how pedagogical instructions facilitate the scaffolding in ITSs, by conducting a case study on guiding children to describe images for language learning. We construct different types of scaffolding tutoring systems grounded in four fundamental learning theories: knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, dialogic teaching, and zone of proximal development. For qualitative and quantitative analyses, we build and refine a seven-dimension rubric to evaluate the scaffolding process. In our experiment on GPT-4V, we observe that LLMs demonstrate strong potential to follow pedagogical instructions and achieve self-paced learning in different student groups. Moreover, we extend our evaluation framework from a manual to an automated approach, paving the way to benchmark various conversational tutoring systems. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With increasing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) in the education industry, intelligent tutoring system (ITS) powered by AI have been widely adopted to optimize the learning experience. However, the relationship between students' engagement level of Generative AI (GenAI) and their academic performance is still under exploration. Also current popular GenAI products like ChatGPT suffer from the hallucination problem, which includes factuality, faithfulness, and maliciousness issues in the generated answer. This paper presents GPTutor, an ITS leveraging GenAI to support students' learning processes. GPTutor integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver actual and contextually rich answers aligned to student questions and intended learning outcomes (ILO). A pilot evaluation involving undergraduate and postgraduate students assessed the system's association with user experience, engagement, and academic performance. Results demonstrated that students generally recognize the effectiveness of GPTutor. Some students also provided insightful feedback on the benefits of GPTutor in improving learning efficiency and some limitations to be addressed. Notably, students with higher engagement levels showed significantly better academic performance on the final exam. This study proposed GPTutor to provide an interactive and knowledge-grounded learning experience and showed the strong association between students' engagement in GPTutor and academic performance.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Given the considerable importance of the English language as a common method of global communication, supporting and engaging learning environments for studying English as a second language are essential. In this study, we propose an interactive agent that considers differences in learners’ skill levels to help motivate learners and support independent study. The proposed agent is an AI chatbot that can vary the complexity of its natural language interactions as learners’ skills improve and engage in unstructured conversations with users. We first collected a dataset of English conversations among children and then acquired data on learners’ utterances of words and sentences using an interactive interface for skill evaluation. Based on these datasets, we generated a set of personalized conversational agents by using algorithms to evaluate speakers’ pronunciation and sentences. Finally, an expert in English language learning evaluated the interactive system to ensure that it could support learners with different levels of proficiency and that the application may be expected to help motivate students to learn. The results showed that the interactive teachable agent could help motivate students who may not otherwise be interested in learning by using a more personalized approach tailored to their skill level. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - AI-generated virtual instructors powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment online learning by making it more interactive and personalized. In this work, we focus specifically on applying this technology to financial literacy education, a critical life skill that is unfortunately undertaught in most school systems. To investigate this potential, we developed three conditions for delivering financial education: A) a Passive Virtual Instructor, B) an Interactive Virtual Instructor powered by LLMs to enable two-way conversation with the learner, and C) a Personally Selected Interactive Virtual Instructor, allowing learners to choose their preferred AI instructor. In a study with 90 participants aged 18–25, we found that incorporating interactivity significantly improved learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and humanness compared to the passive agent. The ability to personally select an instructor provided little additional benefit for most measures. These results highlight the potential of interactive virtual instructors for enhancing motivational and experiential factors, even if comprehension itself is unaffected. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in K-12 social studies education presents a complex blend of opportunities and challenges. This paper explores the transformative potential and ethical dilemmas of employing AI, particularly in engaging with historical primary sources. Utilizing a Delphi methodology, this study captures insights from social studies educators on AI's role in enhancing or complicating the teaching and learning process. The research reveals the transformative potential of AI to deepen historical understanding and empathy through innovative tools, yet it also underscores significant concerns about the accuracy, representation of historical events and figures, and the authenticity of educational content. This exploration presents the paradox inherent in educational AI: its ability to radically transform learning experiences with innovative tools while also threatening to obscure the distinction between historical accuracy and fabrication. The emerging capabilities of generative AI prompt vital questions concerning the legitimacy of information, trustworthiness, and authenticity in historical representation. We consider the implications of AI for pedagogy, emphasizing the need for instructional approaches that engage students in the critical analysis of complex influences shaping historical narratives and visual representations. The paper also addresses the role of AI in perpetuating or challenging historical narratives and biases. It underscores the importance of critical theory in social studies education to analyze the impact of synthetic media and conversational AI agents on students’ perceptions of history. We emphasize the need for collaboration between educators, technologists, and historians to ensure that AI tools enrich the educational landscape without compromising the integrity and complexity of historical understanding. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Virtual reality learning environments are platforms where adaptive, personalized learning can occur in an authentic environment. Pedagogical agents in the virtual reality learning environment can augment adaptive learning scenarios based on natural language conversations with the learner. However, the development of an effective and efficient pedagogical agent that can converse with the learner in a natural way through natural speech in virtual reality learning environments persists as a significant challenge. Consideration of extant theory reveals a lack of evidence-based guidance on the design principles for pedagogical agents in a virtual reality learning environment which constitutes the rationale for this study. This study applies the design science research methodology to guide the design, development, and evaluation of a theory-based artefact. The paper will report on the first phase which presents the literature-based design aspects of a pedagogical agent in a virtual reality learning environment. The contribution of the paper is a list of literature-based guidelines on designing pedagogical agents for virtual reality learning environment. This is proposed as a theoretically based point of departure in developing pedagogical agents that can converse efficiently and effectively in natural language. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This paper presents a strategy designed to evaluate AI-supplemented teaching and learning in a course belonging to a master program in Computer Science at the University of South-Eastern Norway. The strategy was closely related to the delivery format adopted in this program, where students take only one course at a time. Each course lasts for 6 weeks, comprising an initial 'reading week', an 'intensive lectures' week, a 3-week 'project assignment', and one 'assessment week'. The university supported the cost of OpenAI Plus account subscriptions offered to each student while the course was running, and specific activities were proposed to the class exploring the different ways in which AI tutoring could be used during each one of the 4 phases included in the course work plan. The strategy can be adapted to other program delivery formats by redistributing the proposed activities in accordance with the planned sequence of learning activities. It is also independent of which generative AI tool is selected, although OpenAI Plus accounts allow access to specific features that offer relevant pedagogical benefits, e.g., a simple process to create private language models that are easily customizable to each course subject.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - As education constitutes an essential development standard for individuals and societies, researchers have been exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain and have embedded the technology within it through a myriad of applications. In order to provide a detailed overview of the efforts, this article pays particular attention to these developments by highlighting key application areas of data-driven AI in education; it also analyzes existing tools, research trends, as well as limitations of the role data-driven AI can play in education. In particular, this article reviews various applications of AI in education including student grading and assessments, student retention and drop-out predictions, sentiment analysis, intelligent tutoring, classroom monitoring, and recommender systems. This article also provides a detailed bibliometric analysis to highlight the salient research trends in AI in education over nine years (2014-2022) and further provides a detailed description of the tools and platforms developed as the outcome of research and development efforts in AI in education. For the bibliometric analysis, articles from several top venues are analyzed to explore research trends in the domain. The analysis shows sufficient contribution in the domain from different parts of the world with a clear lead for the United States. Moreover, students' grading and evaluation have been observed as the most widely explored application. Despite the significant success, we observed several aspects of education where AI alone has not contributed much. We believe such detailed analysis is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) are frequently used for educational assessments for their efficiency in grading and providing feedback. However, manually generating MCQs has some limitations and challenges. This study explores an AI-driven approach to creating and evaluating Bloom’s Taxonomy-aligned college-level biology MCQs using a varied number of shots in few-shot prompting with GPT-4. Shots, or examples of correct prompt-response pairs, were sourced from previously published datasets containing educator-approved MCQs labeled with their Bloom’s taxonomy and were matched to prompts via a maximal marginal relevance search. To obtain ground truths to compare GPT-4 against, three expert human evaluators with a minimum of 4 years of educational experience annotated a random sample of the generated questions with regards to relevance to the input prompt, classroom usability, and perceived Bloom’s Taxonomy level. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of an AI-driven evaluation approach that can rate question usability using the Item Writing Flaws (IWFs) framework. We conclude that GPT-4 generally shows promise in generating relevant and usable questions. However, more work needs to be done to improve Bloom-level alignment accuracy (accuracy of alignment between GPT-4’s target level and the actual level of the generated question). Moreover, we note that a general inverse relationship exists between alignment accuracy and number of shots. On the other hand, no clear trend between shot number and relevance/usability was observed. These findings shed light on automated question generation and assessment, presenting the potential for advancements in AI-driven educational evaluation methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - As blended learning moved toward a new phase during the COVID-19 pandemic, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology provided opportunities to develop more diverse and dynamic blended learning. This systematic review focused on publications related to the use of AI applications in blended learning. The original studies from January 2007 to October 2023 were extracted from the Google Scholar, ERIC, and Web of Science databases. Finally, 30 empirical studies under the inclusion criteria were reviewed based on two conceptual frameworks: four key challenges of blended learning and three roles of AI. We found that AI applications have been used mainly for the online asynchronous individual learning component in blended learning; little work has been conducted on AI applications that help connect online activities with classroom-based offline activities. Many studies have identified the role of AI as a direct mediator to help control flexibility and autonomy of students in blended learning. However, abundant studies have also identified AI as a supplementary assistant using advanced learning analytics technologies that promote effective interactions with students and facilitate the learning process. Finally, the fewest number of studies have explored the role of AI as a new subject such as use as pedagogical agents or robots. Considering the advancements of generative AI technologies, we expect more research on AI in blended learning. The findings of this study suggested that future studies should guide teachers and their smart AI partner to implement blended learning more effectively. © 2024, Athabasca University.

AB  - Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student’s error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4’s annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

AB  - After many years of relatively limited capabilities for generative language models, recent large language models (LLM's) have demonstrated qualitatively better capabilities for understanding, synthesis, and inference on text. Due to the prominence of ChatGPT's chat system, both the media and many educational developers have suggested using generative AI to directly tutor students. However, despite surface-level similarity between ChatGPT interactions and tutoring dialogs, generative AI has other strengths which may be substantially more relevant for intelligent tutoring (e.g., detecting misconceptions, improved language translation, content generation) and weaknesses that make it problematic for on-the-fly tutoring (e.g., hallucinations, lack of pedagogical training data). In this paper, we discuss how we are approaching generative LLM's for tutoring dialogs, for problems such as multiconcept short answer grading and semi-supervised interactive content generation. This work shows interesting opportunities for prompt engineering approaches for short-answer classification, despite sometimes quirky behavior. The time savings for high-quality content generation for tutoring is not yet clear and further research is needed. The paper concludes with a consideration of longer-term equity and access in a world where essential capabilities require low-latency real-time connections to large, pay-peruse models. Risks and mitigating technologies for this kind of “AI digital divide” are discussed, including optimized/edge-computing LLM's and using generative AI models as simulated students to train specialized tutoring models. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This research full paper describes a web-based online learning platform that delivers financial literacy lessons via talking head videos of AI-generated personas with two additional core features: LLM-powered proactive chat-based question-and-answer interactivity, and personal choice of the AI instructor from a list of distinct personas. We conducted two comparative studies with a total of 233 Thai students aged 1825, which aim to 1) investigate the impact of interactivity and instructor selection on the learning experience, and 2) further explore the underlying factors at play with instructor selection by introducing AI instructors' backstories as an extra intervention. We found that enabling interactivity significantly enhanced learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and virtual instructors' humanness compared to the passive setting. Providing learners with a choice of AI instructors provided minimal additional benefit. However, the learner's feeling of relatedness toward the instructor is a significant positive predictor of learning motivation, positive emotion, and agent credibility, while goal alignment with the agent correlates with perceived learning facilitation, and admiration corresponds with perceived agent humanness. These findings underscore the potential of interactive virtual instructors-ones that interactively encourage learners to reflect on the teaching materials throughout the lesson through two-way interaction-in enhancing motivational and experiential aspects of remote education, even if they do not significantly impact comprehension, and the importance of promoting learner's relatedness and goal alignment with the agent in boosting other aspects of the learning experience. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In an environment where English is a foreign language (English as a foreign language: EFL), English learners use AI voice chatbots for English-speaking practice activities. They enhance their speaking motivation and provide opportunities for communication practice, ultimately leading to English language learning. It can improve their speaking skills. However, if they are preschoolers or elementary school students with no experience learning English, a conversation may not be possible using the AI voice chatbot system. In this study, we propose a teachable agent using an AI voice chatbot that can be easily used even for elementary school students and can enhance the learning effect. The existing Teachable Agent is a method that makes inferences with the knowledge acquired from the learner and answers questions using a path search algorithm. However, applying the Teachable Agent system to language learning is complex, an activity based on tense, context, and memory. This paper proposed a new TA method by reflecting the learner's English pronunciation and level to the teachable agent and generating the agent's answer according to the learner's error. Moreover, a teachable Agent AI chatbot prototype was implemented with an AI voice chatbot. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - An adaptive learning system aims to provide learning that is adapted to a learner’s current status, different from the traditional classroom experience. A key element of an adaptive learning system is the recommendation system, which provides the most suitable resources based on learner profiles. Recommending the most appropriate learning resources to learners has always been a challenge in the field of e-learning. Thus, learners may have difficulties in choosing the appropriate material when faced with a large volume of recommended material during their learning process. This challenge led us to implement a chatbot to help learners improve their learning experience and knowledge. New solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). The use of our chatbot integrated in Moodle, named LearningPartnerBot, provides learners a personalized recommendation of learning objects according to two strategies, one based on their knowledge level (KL) and the other based on their learning style (LS). The objective of this article is to compare the learning outcomes obtained after the realization of the two experiments based on these two approaches centered mainly on the use of the LearningPartnerBot. Consequently, the approach of recommending learning objects based on the knowledge level gave promising results by guaranteeing a more adapted learning to the learners. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancement and adoption, and are increasingly being used in educational contexts. In this perspective article, we explore the open challenge of leveraging LLMs to create personalized learning environments that support the “whole learner” by modeling and adapting to both cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics. We identify three key challenges toward this vision: (1) improving the interpretability of LLMs' representations of whole learners, (2) implementing adaptive technologies that can leverage such representations to provide tailored pedagogical support, and (3) authoring and evaluating LLM-based educational agents. For interpretability, we discuss approaches for explaining LLM behaviors in terms of their internal representations of learners; for adaptation, we examine how LLMs can be used to provide context-aware feedback and scaffold non-cognitive skills through natural language interactions; and for authoring, we highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in using natural language instructions to specify behaviors of educational agents. Addressing these challenges will enable personalized AI tutors that can enhance learning by accounting for each student's unique background, abilities, motivations, and socioemotional needs.

AB  - This research full paper proposes an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to support the study of software project management, considering the students' learning styles. The learning process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that varies significantly from one person to another. Everyone absorbs knowledge differently because each has learning characteristics that directly impact the learning process. Ignoring these differences can result in inefficient and demotivating teaching. Therefore, teachers must invest time in understanding each student's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses, which can be overwhelming, especially in classrooms with a high student-teacher ratio. In this scenario, AI-based technology can be a strong ally. For example, chatbot technology offers an opportunity to adapt to these individual differences and to enable a more engaging and friendly approach for students, contributing to an active and interactive learning environment when exercising the role of a study companion and, why not, a bit of study guide. In this context, this paper proposes developing and applying a chatbot-based ITS called Juh to identify each student's learning style and, based on this understanding, present study activities appropriate to their learning style. The ITS uses meaningful learning theory to personalize the learning journey, detecting five profiles: active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative. This study chose project management (PM) as its knowledge area, particularly project management methodologies, aiming to evaluate the benefits of this research proposal. In this context, this research proposes to answer the following research question: RQ) How can the study of project management be supported actively and interactively, considering the students' learning styles? As its main contribution, the solution aims to offer support in the introduction to the study of project management and improve the learning experience according to the individual characteristics of each student, maximizing the assimilation of knowledge. Therefore, the difference lies in exploring how and what to learn. The solution was developed using the Design Science Research method and the low code Blip platform. After prototyping and evaluating the ITS with PM and education experts, promising points about the approach were observed, with users highlighting improvements in productivity and ease of use of the tutoring system. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Integration of AI in higher education presents a variety of areas that can enhance the learning experience among students. The adaptive AI learning systems or personalized education can use advancement to increase the learning outcome and students' engagement through personalized education, which primarily customizes the contents and pacing to fit the needs of the student. AI-driven virtual assistants and chatbots can help students outside the classroom with any kind of quick assistance to provide smooth learning experiences. Further, AI is going to bring a change in research in higher education with new speeds of discovery and innovation through AI. Machine learning techniques can analyze big data sets and even discover trends and relationships between the data that human researchers would overlook, thereby growing under many lines of studies. Further still, natural language processing, among other AI-driven tools, may empower researchers to sensitize from literature reviews and data analysis to hypothesis generation, enabling them to make more informed decisioning in line with advancing scientific knowledge. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This work-in-progress research-to-practice paper describes a systematic literature review on the use of chatbots in programming courses. We scoped existing peer-reviewed and published articles focusing on the strength of custom-built chatbots and generative AI chatbots in computer engineering education - specifically, courses that employ C++, Java, and Python programming languages. The purpose of this work is to obtain in-depth information about chatbots, with a focus on their functionality, application, and effectiveness. We were also interested in the extent to which learning taxonomies and frameworks are integrated with chatbots. This study adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework to review n=20 articles. Based on the reviews, we provide a set of guidelines on how learning taxonomies and instructional design frameworks can be mapped while developing or implementing chatbots in programming courses. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support self-regulated learning (SRL) because of its strong anthropomorphic characteristics. However, most studies of AI in education have focused on cognitive outcomes in higher education, and little research has examined how psychological needs affect SRL with AI in the K–12 setting. SRL is a self-directed process driven by psychological factors that can be explained by the three basic needs of self-determination theory (SDT), i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This study fills a research gap by examining the moderating effects of need satisfaction and gender in predicting SRL among Grade 9 students. The results indicate that girls perceive more need support than boys. In predicting SRL, satisfaction of the need for autonomy and competence is moderated by both gender and AI knowledge, whereas satisfaction of the need for relatedness is moderated by gender only. Particularly among girls, the effects of autonomy and competence more strongly predict SRL when AI knowledge is low. These findings confirm the gender differences in need satisfaction when predicting SRL with a chatbot. The findings have implications for both teacher instruction and the design and development of intelligent learning environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the rise of mobile learning platforms, it has become increasingly evident that individuals require personalized experiences that are tailored to the strengths and limitations of mobile devices. The present study explores the significant impact that personalized mobile learning environments, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), could have. This study specifically evaluates the impact of an AI-driven personalized educational platform, designed for mobile devices, on the academic achievement and educational progress of students at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. The platform, designed for mobile devices, allows instructors to easily upload information. Learners can interact with an AI mentor through a chat interface that is seamlessly integrated into their mobile course materials. The system, constructed using cutting-edge technologies such as Langchain, Pinecone, and the LLM Model, excels at providing personalized, real-time feedback and support for learners who are frequently mobile. This study compared two groups of students. One group had access to a mobile personalized learning platform powered by AI, whereas the control group did not have access to it. We conducted a comparative analysis of mobile educational experiences, levels of engagement, and academic outcomes across these groups. In addition, qualitative feedback was gathered from educators and students to evaluate the mobile usability and effectiveness of the system. The results of our study demonstrate that the AI-driven mobile-tailored learning system significantly improves the experience of mobile learners. The increased levels of engagement, improved understanding, and superior academic achievements support our claim. This study not only supports the potential of AI-driven personalized mobile learning in higher education but also emphasizes the importance of continuous innovation to improve its usefulness and effectiveness. © 2024 by the authors of this article.

AB  - This systematic review provides unique findings with an up-to-date examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the US to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72%. Similar to the findings of other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the AIEd was intended for 72% of the studies focused on students, 17% instructors, and 11% managers. In answering the overarching question of how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools, such as Chat GPT. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of education due to its rapid expansion in educational technology by introducing personalized and efficient learning experiences. Several artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being integrated into this research project such as 'Coursera Coach powered by Generative AI' which incorporates adaptive learning, 'AI- assisted course building powered by Generative AI' which incorporates intelligent tutoring elements and 'Turnitin' offers tools for grading and providing feedback to revolutionize teaching, learning, and assessment practices in higher education. Researchers evaluate the effectiveness of AI tools in enhancing student engagement, personalizing learning experiences, and optimizing assessment processes based on a variety of quantitative metrics. A comparison is made between experimental groups that follow AI-integrated teaching methods and control groups that follow a traditional approach to instruction. As part of the study, scores of pre- and post-assessment questions were collected, learning progression patterns were analyzed, and instructors and students provided qualitative feedback. As a result of the experimental data, it has been possible to discern which AI tools have strengths and limitations within the context of higher education. A variety of adaptive learning platforms are evaluated for their ability to adjust content to individual learning styles, while intelligent tutoring systems are assessed for their impact on comprehension, retention, and problem-solving skills. Automated grading tools are tested for their efficiency gains in assessment processes and their ability to improve feedback promptness and quality. A substantial amount of empirical evidence is provided by the findings of this study to the ongoing discourse on AI integration in higher education. This study provides a wealth of actionable insights for academic staff, technicians, and administrators seeking evidence-based strategies for implementing AI technologies in their educational frameworks.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the pivotal axis around which transformation revolves is human-AI interaction. In this sense, this paper adopts a data mining and analytic approach to understand what the related literature tells us regarding the trends and patterns of generative AI research in educational praxis. Accordingly, this systematic exploration spotlights the following research themes: Interaction and communication with generative AI-powered chatbots; impact of the LLMs and generative AI on teaching and learning, conversational educational agents and their opportunities, challenges, and implications; leveraging Generative AI for enhancing social and cognitive learning processes; promoting AI literacy for unleashing future opportunities; harnessing Generative AI to expand academic capabilities, and lastly, augmenting educational experiences through human-AI interaction. Beyond the identified research themes and patterns, this paper argues that emotional intelligence, AI literacy, and prompt engineering are the trending research topics that require further exploration. Accordingly, it’s in this praxis that emotional intelligence emerges as a pivotal attribute, as AI technologies often struggle to comprehend and respond to the nuanced emotional cues. Generative AI literacy then takes center stage, becoming an indispensable asset in an era permeated with AI technologies, equipping students with the tools to critically engage with AI systems, thereby ensuring they become active, discerning users of these powerful tools. Concurrently, prompt engineering, the art of crafting queries that yield precise and valuable responses from AI systems, empowers both educators and students to maximize the utility of AI-driven educational resources. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Computing educators face significant challenges in providing timely support to students, especially in large class settings. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors, and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students’ usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that they provide to students. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The recent launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI has created a profound global impact, initiating deep questions among educators about how it might affect education, syllabi and teaching methods. Currently, the full scope of potential benefits and risks associated with ChatGPT in education remains unclear, given that its impact surpasses the level of preparation educators and institutions may have had for such a pre-trained generative AI tool. While Artificial Intelligence in Education has long been a subject of research, with a particular focus on developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems, the emergence of ChatGPT marks a distinctive advancement in this field. Unlike dedicated Intelligent Tutoring Systems, ChatGPT is readily available to a diverse spectrum of educational stakeholders, including teachers, students, schools, universities, and educational institutions. Scholars have initiated assessments of ChatGPT's effectiveness across various educational disciplines, even though ChatGPT was not explicitly designed for educational purposes. However, the widespread accessibility of ChatGPT, coupled with its extensive knowledge base, necessitates the development of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. In this paper, we introduce a holistic evaluation framework tailored for ChatGPT. This framework takes into account both soft and hard skills, and it is designed to seamlessly incorporate ChatGPT into Intelligent Tutoring Systems, making it suitable for a wide range of educational fields. By establishing a connection between ITS and ChatGPT, as they are both AI tools, we can benefit from the substantial background work achieved by previous research in ITSs to evaluate the educational influence of ChatGPT. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat in higher education shows excellent potential for transformation. However, this integration also raises issues in maintaining academic integrity and preventing plagiarism. In this study, we investigate and analyze practical approaches for efficiently harnessing the potential of GAI while simultaneously ensuring the preservation of assignment integrity. Despite the potential to expedite the learning process and improve accessibility, concerns regarding academic misconduct highlight the necessity for the implementation of novel GAI frameworks for higher education. To effectively tackle these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework, PAIGE (Promoting Assignment Integrity using Generative AI in Education). This framework emphasizes the ethical integration of GAI, promotes active student interaction, and cultivates opportunities for peer learning experiences. Higher education institutions can effectively utilize the PAIGE framework to leverage the promise of GAI while ensuring the preservation of assignment integrity. This approach paves the way for a responsible and thriving future in Generative AI-driven education. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by AIMS, LLC.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in educational settings to assist students with assignments and learning new concepts. For LLMs to be effective learning aids, students must develop an appropriate level of trust and reliance on these tools. Misaligned trust and reliance can lead to suboptimal learning outcomes and reduced LLM engagement. Despite their growing presence, there is a limited understanding of achieving optimal transparency and reliance calibration in the educational use of LLMs. In a 3x2 between-subjects experiment conducted in a university classroom setting, we tested the effect of two transparency disclosures (System Prompt and Goal Summary) and an in-conversation Reliability Disclaimer on a GPT-4-based chatbot tutor provided to students for an assignment. Our findings suggest that disclaimer messages included in the responses may effectively mitigate learners' overreliance on the LLM Tutor in the presence of incorrect advice. Disclosing System Prompt seemed to calibrate students’ confidence in their answers and reduce the occurrence of copy-pasting the exact assignment question to the LLM tutor. Student feedback indicated that they would like transparency framed in terms of performance-based metrics. Our work provides empirical insights on the design of transparency and reliability mechanisms for using LLMs in classrooms settings. © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - There is growing evidence to suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be beneficial to people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), many of whom suffer from multiple comorbidities. People with ASD often do not respond well to CBT though. It is acknowledged that CBT requires adaptations to accommodate experienced socio-communication and neuropsychological impairments, but there is little evidence on how best to adapt CBT to optimise treatment outcomes for people with ASD. This paper proposes an affect-aware chatbot-based intervention in the form of an animated pedagogical as a means to inform the development of the effective and acceptable adaption of CBT to meet specific needs of autistic populations in the classroom. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This work introduces design for a Generative AI (Gen-AI) based tutoring system customized for Egyptian community schools needs. Community schools are managed by NGOs as an alternative education to unprivileged students who missed the formal government education. Our research involved working with an Egyptian NGO and a community school in upper Egypt from March 2023 to September 2023. Several workshops were conducted with involved stakeholders and end users to collect the requirements for such a system. The proposed design reflects the views of management, teachers and student parents.It also adhere to Haman-Centered AI (HCAI) principles which prioritize human values and experiences. This paper lists the outcomes of this process and surveys potential tools that can be used in this system. The findings emphasize the need for Gen-AI to act as a teacher's assistant rather than a replacement, it also highlights the need for localization as well as the need for an end-to-end solution rather than developing an isolated AI-based module. The proposed Gen-AI tutoring system integrates Generative AI, a Learning Management System (LMS), and comprehensive reporting dashboards. This design aims to meet the technical and pedagogical requirements of community school environments and produces a trusted tutoring system that empowers teachers and students.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Advancements in the generative AI field have enabled the development of powerful educational avatars. These avatars embody a human and can, for instance, listen to users’ spoken input, generate an answer utilizing a large-language model, and reply by speaking with a synthetic voice. A theoretical introduction summarizes essential steps in developing AI-based educational avatars and explains how they differ from previously available educational technologies. Moreover, we introduce GPTAvatar, an open-source, state-of-the-art AI-based avatar. We then discuss the benefits of using AI-based educational avatars, which include, among other things, individualized and contextualized instruction. Afterward, we highlight the challenges of using AI-based educational avatars. Major problems concern incorrect and inaccurate information provided, as well as insufficient data protection. In the discussion, we provide an outlook by addressing advances in educational content and educational technology and identifying three crucial open questions for research and practice.

AB  - This innovative practice WIP paper describes a pedagogical approach to use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to promote critical thinking among students in the fields of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC). Technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, impacting many aspects of human interaction. AEC are among the fields experiencing this rapid technological evolution. Since education in these areas is continuously improving and adapting to new technologies, the motivation behind this study is to explore how GenAI can support the development of critical thinking in AEC. The correct use of GenAI as a tool in education is crucial for ensuring that students benefit from its capabilities while retaining their own analytical skills. Recognizing the potential of this technology in the professional world, this study focuses on college-level students in architecture and civil engineering courses to promote critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a complementary tool to enhance learning experience. Harnessing GenAI to cultivate critical thinking skills among students can enhance their ability to tackle complex problems and adapt to technological advancements. The main objective of this ongoing study is to explore the integration og GenAI into the learning process to foster critical thinking skills. To achieve this, students in AEC courses at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) were introduced to a GenAI application to generate summaries points of specific themes. Then, students were instructed to engage in three rounds of answers-based questioning to further explore the topic from a critical thinking lens. The instructor provided guidance on formulating questions to encourage reflective and critical thinking. Students reported on their interactions, detailing the path of questions and answers and their viewpoints on the assigned topic at the end of the experiment. After the exercise, researchers administered an open-ended survey to gather qualitative information on student's perspective regarding the impact of the GenAI on their learning process and critical thinking development. Data were collected from students of various academic years and AEC specialties, providing insights into their critical thinking development in different contexts. The study also analyzes potential factors influencing the relationship between GenAI use, academic performance and critical thinking in AEC education. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are changing education and offer new opportunities for how people interact with environments. Technological advances over the past few decades have lowered barriers to creating virtual environments; however, there are still challenges, particularly when creating realistic virtual environments of real places. Realism is important as the fidelity of virtual environments influences user experience. In addition, methods and techniques that can facilitate ease of interacting with these environments are needed to streamline the user experience. One promising way to do this is incorporating AI-driven avatars into realistic scenes, allowing users to use natural language immersive learning experiences focused on sustainability education that incorporate realistic scenes to interact with and learn about the landscapes. To this end, we have developed workflows for design scenarios and natural interaction with AI avatars. This study created point cloud digital 3D models from photogrammetry and incorporated these into Unreal Engine 5. We then integrated generative AI avatars into the environment, enabling natural language interaction between users and an AI tutor. The integration facilitates interactive participation and enables high-precision digital reproduction of the physical environment. The novel proposed workflow is presented via a case study for a virtual study abroad experience in Naxos, Greece, using an AI-driven tutor to educate about the historical aspects of the island. This project provides the beneficial learning experience of study abroad experiences without the economic and environmental costs of sending students on field excursions. We recommend constructing immersive education experiences using real-world environments and natural AI-driven conversations and demonstrating its potential to revolutionize social interaction, historical heritage preservation, and sustainable pedagogy. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.

AB  - Programming is a creative activity, but it can be difficult to learn due to constant updates, poorly maintained documentation, and unexpected errors. One reason for the difficulties is the shortage of programming teachers, which often leaves students unable to get help when they need it, even for simple questions. Many unanswered questions are a barrier to improving programming skills for creative purposes. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue by exploring whether an AI-based system can help reduce the difficulties faced by students. Recent advancements in deep learning technology have made it easier for teachers to train AI models that can learn from their own experiences in the classroom, including the types of questions, requests, and difficulties that students encounter. We have developed an AI model that can translate Python code from Japanese by using machine translation techniques and large language models. We have integrated this model into a learning assistant system that suggests code to students when they express their programming intentions. In this paper, we present our experiences in developing and deploying this AI-based assistant in the classroom, as well as the feedback we have received from students. By sharing our initial experiences, we aim to envision the potential of educational AI development for the future. © 2024 Information Processing Society of Japan.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted great interest in higher education, highly influenced by the development of information and communication technologies. Integrating artificial intelligence into learning ecosystems is one of the biggest challenges for higher education. In this work, an intelligent tutoring system based on AI has been designed but with control of the possible responses. For this, a first diagnostic phase was carried out that determined the selection of initial material that will be used by the neural network or classifier algorithm, so that the teacher has control of the answers offered, limiting the sources of information used. Subsequently, this selection of documents is part of the input, together with the question in a large language model (LLM) ChatGPT-type conversational network. All developments have been done using open access resources. It is the first stage of a project to obtain a predictive analysis of each learning studding. © 2024 International Conference on Higher Education Advances.

AB  - As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, concerns exist regarding their accuracy and potential for hallucination. However, few studies evaluate performance systematically across academic contexts. This paper summarizes three case studies assessing LLM accuracy in classroom analytics exercises. In the first, students tested ChatGPT 3.5 responses to technical questions in graduate courses over 12 weeks. Over 95% factual concordance was found, with repetition being the primary inconsistency. The second study successfully replicated 167 statistical analyses from an Excel exercise book in ChatGPT 4 covering techniques like regression and inference. No discernible accuracy issues appeared. The third case evaluated Claude 2 and ChatGPT 4 on Harvard Business School cases and associated questions across four subjects, with student teams finding perfect alignment with faculty provided solutions. Collectively, the case studies reveal three key themes. First, constrained problem scopes limit deviations in accuracy. Second, performance relies on relevant domain exposure during pretraining. Third, high grading agreements position LLMs as credible teaching assistants, though personalization and originality remain inadequate. Contrary to wider benchmarks, LLMs demonstrate high fidelity on academic tasks, allaying concerns about hallucination. Speculatively, restricted interfaces could enhance reliability. Domain-specific finetuning also remains vital. The studies support LLMs' use for automated tutoring and analysis, complementing human educators. Further assessments on more advanced reasoning tasks are still necessary. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Pedagogical agent is a software agent that provides guidance, feedback, or intervention to learners in digital environments. It has the potential to address issues in computer-based learning, particularly online learning, which often neglects affective aspects, such as the emotions of its users. Most systematic literature reviews (SLR) on pedagogical agent have focused on their visual design, types of feedback, and other empirical elements. However, what underlies these agents' ability to provide interventions personalized to learner's emotions has not been examined. So, this SLR explores how pedagogical agent has addressed learner's emotional needs. The study's research questions include: 1) To what extent does research exist on models, frameworks, or architectures for pedagogical agent, especially those related to emotions? 2) How are pedagogical agent represented, what types of interventions do they use, and how do they affect learner's emotions? 3) What kinds of inputs are used to activate the pedagogical agent's functions? This SLR applied the Kitchenham method to select reference sources from 2013 to 2023 and was indexed by Scopus in the Q1 to Q4 range. Our review revealed the absence of a specific model for mapping out interventions tailored to the learner's emotional needs. Most existing pedagogical agent provide learning interventions that are less adaptive and personalized based on the learner's emotional state and are applied to asynchronous learning systems such as e-learning. There are still very few pedagogical agents that use real-time input technology by utilizing artificial intelligence to recognize learner's emotion to trigger an adaptive and personalized intervention.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in engineering education has the potential to revolutionize how we teach and learn. However, it also raises many ethical and practical concerns, such as perpetuating and amplifying biases and inequalities, potential cheating issues, and even the possibility of replacing human educators altogether. While AI has already begun to enter the field of higher education, the recent introduction of new powerful AI chatbots will undoubtedly rapidly democratize the use of AI in education for both educators and students. In the current literature on AI in education, there is a lack of practical examples to help us better understand the full potential impact of AI on education. This paper addresses this gap by discussing the implementation and effectiveness of AI-powered intelligent tutoring systems in engineering education and exploring the ethical and practical considerations of their use. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Introduction Therapeutic education for patients with asthma has been shown to reduce asthma morbidity. The high availability of smart phones provides the opportunity to furnish patient training via specifically designed chatbot applications. The goal of this protocol is to perform a first pilot comparison of traditional face to face versus chatbot-guided patient therapeutic education programmes for patients with asthma. Methods and analysis Eighty adult patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of asthma will be enrolled in a two-parallel-arm, randomised (1:1) controlled pilot trial. A single-Zelen consent procedure is deployed to first enrol all participants in the comparator arm, that is, the standard patient therapeutic education programme at the University Hospitals of Montpellier, France. This means of patient therapeutic education is based on reoccurring interviews and discussion with qualified nursing staff as per usual care. Following baseline data acquisition, randomisation will be performed. Those patients randomised to the comparator arm will not be informed of the second arm. Those patients randomised to the experimental arm will be proposed access to a specifically designed chatbot (Vik-Asthme) as the second tested means of patient training (refusals continue with standard training, though analysed as intention to treat). The primary outcome is change in the total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score at the end of follow-up (6 months). Secondary outcomes cover asthma control, spirometry, general health status, programme adherence and burden for medical staff, exacerbations and medical resource use (medications, consults, emergency visits, hospitalisation and intensive care). Ethics and dissemination This study ('AsthmaTrain' protocol version 4-20220330) has been approved by the Committee for the Protection of Persons Ile-de-France VII on 28 March 2022 (reference number 21.03617.000059). Enrolment began on 24 May 2022. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number NCT05248126.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - The role of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) has recently become a major topic of discussion and future planning. This article presents data from a large-scale survey involving 1463 Bulgarian educators in primary, secondary, and high schools. The results revealed that 70.30% of the teachers were familiar with or somewhat familiar with the existence of AI applications. Chatbots were the most popular among the surveyed teachers, with ChatGPT ranking as the most familiar. The teachers were almost equally split between those who reported use and those who declared nonuse of AI technology for instructional purposes. A significant association was found between the teachers’ familiarity with and use of AI technology and their age-related generational traits. The younger educators (up to 40 years of age) were associated with higher use of AI technology as a support tool for creating lesson plans, lesson content, tests, and exams. The outlined tendencies can be used to inform policy, professional development, and future research in the realm of AI-driven education. © 2024, Institute for Bulgarian Language. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dialog with a social pedagogical robot or agent is a powerful way for kids to learn [1, 5] but may limit the formation of an agentic relationship with the technology [9]. One main purpose of conversational agents is to allow the user to have a natural interaction that reduces the need to learn artificial conventions [6], but dialog systems fall short with respect to failure recovery, vocabulary diversity, remembering conversational history, and other measures [2, 3]. Further, Hill et. al. [4] found that people adapt their model of communication to match a chatbot's in the same way they do with a child or non-native speaker. Thus, users conversing with a pedagogical agent are implicitly trained to shape their behavior to suit the technology rather than shaping the technology. For young learners, particularly among populations that have been historically excluded from technology fields, this limits agency and reinforces marginalizing power structures [9]. This project combines a conversational agent with ideas of agentic engagement to help middle-school-aged children learn computational thinking. Agentic engagement is defined as students' constructive contribution into the flow of instruction and includes behaviors such as expressing interests, preferences, and opinions. It has been positively correlated to learning performance and motivation [7, 8]. Combined with a culturally responsive curriculum (CRC), agentic engagement may help to foster an agentic relationship with technology. Our system encourages learners to engage agentically by using programming constructs to change the agent's vocabulary, recognizing the intent behind a user utterance (an invocation), and defining the action the agent will take to respond to an invocation. Students use computational thinking concepts such as pattern recognition, abstraction, and decomposition to convert ideas into commands for the dialog system and to understand which of their ideas can't be programmed with the technology as presented. They learn both to personalize the system today and to see the agent as a technosocial construct that they can shape in the future. Programming can be accomplished either using Google's Blockly visual programming tool (https://developers.google.com/blockly) or through conversation with the agent itself. The agent is embodied as a robot character, so agent actions can be verbal, physical, or both. Through social dialog with the agent, learners reflect on how computational thinking is relevant to themselves and their communities as part of a CRC, building on the work of Stewart et. al. [10]. For example, learners may be asked to reflect on the relationship between greeting behaviors and identity. After designing a greeting interaction, learners program the dialog system to achieve the greeting. Then learners may be asked to imagine how they might hypothetically enhance the dialog system to make it even more capable of implementing their preferences. In parallel to the development of the dialog system and curriculum, we will also adapt Reeve's agentic engagement instrument [7] for CRC. Our contributions will include this instrument, insights into the relationship between agentic engagement and an agentic relationship with technology, and insights into how a programmable dialog system impacts agentic engagement and learning computational thinking. © 2021 Owner/Author.

AB  - As we witness groundbreaking advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is clear that the next generation must be equipped with AI literacy: the skill to interact, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems. This study introduces ActiveAI, a scalable web-based tutoring system aligned with AI4K12’s five big ideas in AI, designed to foster AI literacy among K-12 students through active learning and interaction with intelligent agents. A controlled classroom study involving 171 middle school learners was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ActiveAI in fostering AI literacy skills and competency toward AI. Results showed that, compared to students in the tell-and-practice control condition, students who used ActiveAI exhibited higher post-test performance in the module about how next-word prediction and temperature work in large language models. Students also developed higher self-reported competence toward AI after using ActiveAI than in the control condition. We conclude by suggesting assessment designs that promote deeper engagement with AI concepts by addressing students’ common misconceptions, like “AI thinks just like humans”, in K-12 AI literacy education.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Twenty-first-century skills should be integrated into higher education to prepare students for complex working-life challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools have the potential to optimise skill development among higher education students. Therefore, it is important to conceptualise relevant affordances of AI systems for 21st-century skills development in higher education. This study aimed to present an overview of journal articles published in the Web of Science database that specifically addressed the affordances of AI-based tools for 21st-century skills development. Four distinct categories of AI-based tools (intelligent tutoring systems, chatbots, AI-powered dashboards and automated grading systems) were identified as capable of promoting six main 21st-century skills (collaboration, communication, creativity, critical thinking, information and communication technology and problem-solving). The review revealed that the utilisation of AI-based tools might contribute to the simultaneous development of multiple 21st-century skills (e.g., collaboration and critical thinking). The results showed that adaptive feedback from AI plays a significant role as a facilitator in the development of 21st-century skills. Furthermore, the utilisation of diverse functional AI affordances (e.g., prediction and profiling) might contribute to the development of various skills. AI-based technologies appeared to target the 21st-century skills of problem-solving and its subskills the most. © (2024), (Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)).

AB  - This study delves into integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT-powered robots, as educational tools in primary school mathematics. Against the backdrop of Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating educational settings, our investigation focuses on the response of young learners to errors made by these LLM-powered robots. Employing a user study approach, we conducted an experiment using the Pepper robot in a primary school classroom environment, where 77 primary school students from multiple grades (Year 3 to 5) took part in interacting with the robot. Our statistically significant findings highlight that most students, regardless of the year group, could discern between correct and incorrect responses generated by the robots, demonstrating a promising level of understanding and engagement with the AI-driven educational tool. Additionally, we observed that students' correctness in answering the Maths questions significantly influenced their ability to identify errors, underscoring the importance of prior knowledge in verifying LLM responses and detecting errors. Additionally, we examined potential confounding factors such as age and gender. Our findings underscore the importance of gradually integrating AI-powered educational tools under the guidance of domain experts following thorough verification processes. Moreover, our study calls for further research to establish best practices for implementing AI-driven pedagogical approaches in educational settings. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost-efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS, however, are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagogical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions. Through post-hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions, we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts), which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two-step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response, we implemented two CITS models using GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a systematic review dealing with the use of personas, avatars, and characters in conjunction with AI-supported tools such as chatbots or generative AI in education. Although the use generative AI in education is gaining traction, this study seeks to systematically review the body of knowledge dealing with personified and conversational approaches to education with both pre-generative and generative AI. The results of the study emphasize the importance of the three key elements of such systems: the use of pedagogical agents, interaction, and personalization. These key elements can be relevant when considering the adoption of the new generation of generative AI in education. Such systems should scaffold learners' understanding providing guidance and support, promote self-directedness and ensure effectiveness in learning, provide customized learning paths, and promote ethical use. © 2023 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.
