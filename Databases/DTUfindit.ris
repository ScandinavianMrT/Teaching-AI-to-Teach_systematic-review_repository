AB  - With increasing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) in the education industry, intelligent tutoring system (ITS) powered by AI have been widely adopted to optimize the learning experience. However, the relationship between students&#x2019; engagement level of Generative AI (GenAI) and their academic performance is still under exploration. Also current popular GenAI products like ChatGPT suffer from the hallucination problem, which includes factuality, faithfulness, and maliciousness issues in the generated answer. This paper presents GPTutor, an ITS leveraging GenAI to support students' learning processes. GPTutor integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver actual and contextually rich answers aligned to student questions and intended learning outcomes (ILO). A pilot evaluation involving undergraduate and postgraduate students assessed the system&#x2019;s association with user experience, engagement, and academic performance. Results demonstrated that students generally recognize the effectiveness of GPTutor. Some students also provided insightful feedback on the benefits of GPTutor in improving learning efficiency and some limitations to be addressed. Notably, students with higher engagement levels showed significantly better academic performance on the final exam. This study proposed GPTutor to provide an interactive and knowledge-grounded learning experience and showed the strong association between students&#x2019; engagement in GPTutor and academic performance.

AB  - The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.

AB  - The state of education in our country has been a contentious topic for many years. Numerous reforms have been done but there are still some problems – inefficient learning resources, is but one of the many. Due to inexperience on this topic this problem continues to plague the education system. However, taking an informed and educated approach with the interests of the students prioritized, we believe that many of these problems could be solved with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Its proper integration into the education system could aid in the improvement of efficiency of learning resources, through the use of various tools like chatbots, adaptive learning systems and intelligent assessment systems. By implementing the use of AI in a world where learning resources are scarce, there can be standardized learning throughout the country regardless of availability of learning materials. The main agenda of this study is to explore ways of implementing the use of Artificial Intelligence into educational systems to integrate the use of learning materials, hence bringing about improved quality of education. We are fully aware of the problems facing the implementations of this study but we are ready to conduct rigorous research to combat them.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted great interest in higher education, highly influenced by the development of information and communication technologies. Integrating artificial intelligence into learning ecosystems is one of the biggest challenges for higher education. In this work, an intelligent tutoring system based on AI has been designed but with control of the possible responses. For this, a first diagnostic phase was carried out that determined the selection of initial material that will be used by the neural network or classifier algorithm, so that the teacher has control of the answers offered, limiting the sources of information used. Subsequently, this selection of documents is part of the input, together with the question in a large language model (LLM) ChatGPT-type conversational network. All developments have been done using open access resources. It is the first stage of a project to obtain a predictive analysis of each learning studding.

AB  - This work-in-progress innovative practice paper describes a novel integration of Generative AI with Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). CUREs integrate research activities into the curriculum, allowing all students in a course to participate in inquiry-based research projects. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are advanced AI designed to generate human-like responses by processing natural language inputs. These applications leverage machine learning models to produce outputs that can assist users in a variety of tasks from writing to coding. The integration of Generative AI with CURE had been adopted in a text-based machine learning course during the Fall 2023 semester. A comparative analysis had been conducted on student survey responses from Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 to evaluate the effectiveness of Generative AI in a CURE integrated course. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were conducted to assess differences in student perceptions between the two semesters. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the results indicate a promising trend towards improved student perceptions of both the overall course effectiveness and the benefits of Generative AI in enhancing various aspects of the research process, especially the literature review.

AB  - The advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can provide opportunities for enriching educational experiences, but at the same time raise concerns regarding academic integrity. Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner.

AB  - Abstract The growing popularity of generative AI (genAI), particularly ChatGPT, has sparked enthusiasm and caution among education practitioners and researchers. To harness the full potential of generative AI in educational contexts, it is crucial to thoroughly analyze its impact and suitability for different educational purposes. This work serves as an initial step towards our long-term research goal of integrating generative AI as a "brainstorming partner" in the context of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Rather than immediately outlining requirements and developing components for ChatGPT to function as an independent brainstorming partner, the primary objective of this paper is to examine ChatGPT's impact in a collaborative creative ideation process. As an example of CSCL, this paper delves into students' creative group brainstorming activities. In this educational context, the learning objective lies in encouraging students to creatively apply their factual knowledge without rigid concerns about correctness. Diverging from recent concerns about hallucination and academic integrity involving genAI in education, our paper introduces a unique application of genAI where these concerns hold relatively less significance. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the influence of ChatGPT on the creativity of ideas emerging from group brainstorming sessions. Specifically, we describe how students incorporate ChatGPT into their ideation process and observe its impact on the perceived creativity levels of the generated ideas. Additionally, we explore whether leveraging ChatGPT leads to more homogeneous ideas among students, potentially challenging the collaborative and diversity-centric learning objective of group brainstorming. Our investigation involves a statistical analysis and natural language processing techniques to digital logs, discussion messages and product design ideas generated by 33 students over a two-week period in a graduate-level product engineering class. The students were randomly organized into teams comprising of 4 to 5 individuals to engage in group discussions in an online platform. Their task was to brainstorm and discuss new product ideas that aligned with specific user requirements. In select groups, ChatGPT was introduced as an additional member, providing students with the capability to direct questions during their ideation process. Our findings illustrate that students predominantly utilize ChatGPT during their initial ideation stage, injecting their own modifications and enhancements to its responses. Surprisingly, ideas generated with ChatGPT are perceived as more creative by the students, potentially attributed to their relatively detailed descriptions. Furthermore, our observations indicate that the use of ChatGPT does not necessarily lead to homogenous ideas, as students' prompts to ChatGPT and its responses exhibit linguistic diversity. This paper not only offers a unique application of genAI in the educational landscape but also provides valuable insights into the nuanced dynamics of integrating ChatGPT as a collaborative partner during creative ideation. Our results pave the way for further exploration, showcasing the potential of genAI to enhance collaborative learning experiences while fostering creativity among students.

AB  - In this research paper we examine undergraduate students&#x0027; use of and perceptions of generative AI (GenAI). Although the initial hype around ChatGPT has subsided, GenAI applications continue to make inroads across learning activities. Like any other emerging technology, there is a lack of consensus around using GenAI within higher education. Students are early adopters of the technology, utilizing it in atypical ways and forming a range of perceptions and aspirations about it. To understand where and how students are using these tools and how they view them, we present findings from an open-ended survey response study with undergraduate students pursuing information technology degrees. Students were asked to describe 1) their understanding of GenAI; 2) their use of GenAI; 3) their opinions on the benefits, downsides, and ethical issues pertaining to its use in education; and 4) how they envision GenAI could ideally help them with their education. Thirty-seven students provided responses ranging in length from 20 to 300 words for each question. Responses were iteratively coded by researchers to uncover patterns in the data and then categorized thematically. Findings reveal that students&#x0027; definitions of GenAI differed substantially and included many misconceptions - some highlight it as a technique, an application, or a tool, while others described it as a type of AI. There was a wide variation in the use of GenAI by students, with two common uses being writing and coding. They identified the ability of GenAI to summarize information and its potential to personalize learning as an advantage. Students identified two primary ethical concerns with using GenAI: plagiarism and dependency, which means that students do not learn independently. They also cautioned that responses from GenAI applications are often untrustworthy and need verification. Overall, they appreciated that they could do things quickly with GenAI but were cautious as using the technology was not necessarily in their best long-term as it interfered with the learning process. In terms of aspirations for GenAI, students expressed both practical advantages and idealistic and improbable visions. They said it could serve as a tutor or coach and allow them to understand the material better. We discuss the implications of the findings for student learning and instruction.

AB  - This paper introduces MalAlgoQA, a novel dataset designed to evaluate the counterfactual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a pedagogical approach. The dataset comprises mathematics and reading comprehension questions, each accompanied by four answer choices and their corresponding rationales. At the heart of MalAlgoQA are “malgorithms” - rationales behind incorrect answer choices that represent flawed yet logically coherent reasoning paths. These malgorithms serve as counterfactual scenarios, allowing us to assess an LLM's ability to identify and analyze flawed reasoning patterns. We propose the Malgorithm Identification task, where LLMs are assessed based on their ability to identify corresponding malgorithm given an incorrect answer choice. To evaluate the model performance, we introduce two metrics: Algorithm Identification Accuracy (AIA) for correct answer rationale identification, and Malgorithm Identification Accuracy (MIA) for incorrect answer rationale identification. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant performance drops in MIA compared to AIA, highlighting the challenges in counterfactual reasoning. Surprisingly, we find that the chain-of-thought prompting technique not only fails to consistently enhance MIA but can sometimes lead to underperformance compared to simple prompting. These findings have important implications for developing LLMs with improved counterfactual reasoning, particularly relevant for AI-powered tutoring systems, where identifying and addressing student misconceptions is essential. MalAlgoQA dataset is available here.

AB  - Generative AI (GenAI) has seen great advancements in the past two years and the conversation around adoption is increasing. Widely available GenAI tools are disrupting classroom practices as they can write and explain code with minimal student prompting. While most acknowledge that there is no way to stop students from using such tools, a consensus has yet to form on how students should use them if they choose to do so. At the same time, researchers have begun to introduce new pedagogical tools that integrate GenAI into computing curricula. These new tools offer students personalized help or attempt to teach prompting skills without undercutting code comprehension. This working group aims to detail the current landscape of education-focused GenAI tools and teaching approaches, present gaps where new tools or approaches could appear, identify good practice-examples, and provide a guide for instructors to utilize GenAI as they continue to adapt to this new era.

AB  - This article examines the historical and contemporary mobilizations of ‘Luddism’ as a mode of resistance to technological inevitability, particularly in response to the integration of generative AI into education. Tracing three historical ‘waves’ of Luddism–the original nineteenth century machine-breakers, the Neo-Luddites of the late twentieth century, and the present day critics of digital automation–it explores how the term has been mobilized, at different junctures, in service of overlapping (and, at times, competing) political projects. Reading across these ‘waves,’ the article considers what lessons, and cautions, they hold for how education research and practice might confront generative AI and the challenges it introduces for teaching, learning, and school governance.

AB  - The integration of generative AI tools in higher education presents both significant opportunities and challenges. This paper addresses two key questions: how AI should be incorporated into higher education and what ethical and pedagogical principles should guide its use. While AI enhances creativity, efficiency, and personalized learning, it also raises concerns about over-reliance, bias, and ethical implications. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this study examines the ethical and pedagogical impact of AI in education. Findings suggest that institutions must ensure AI complements traditional learning, uphold academic integrity, and promote critical thinking. Human-AI collaboration and equitable access are essential to support diverse learners. Additionally, prioritizing ethical AI use, data privacy, and AI literacy safeguards student rights and prepares educators and students for the evolving technological landscape. The paper concludes that institutions must develop clear AI policies, embed AI ethics into curricula, and provide ongoing faculty training. By addressing these considerations, higher education can harness AI’s benefits while maintaining the critical role of human educators and ensuring equitable and ethical access for all learners.

AB  - With the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the field of higher education rapidly became aware that generative AI can complete or assist in many of the kinds of tasks traditionally used for assessment. This has come as a shock, on the heels of the shock of the pandemic. How should assessment practices change? Should we teach about generative AI or use it pedagogically? If so, how? Here, we propose that a set of open educational practices, inspired by both the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement and digital collaboration practices popularized in the pandemic, can help educators cope and perhaps thrive in an era of rapidly evolving AI. These practices include turning toward online communities that cross institutional and disciplinary boundaries. Social media, listservs, groups, and public annotation can be spaces for educators to share early, rough ideas and practices and reflect on these as we explore emergent responses to AI. These communities can facilitate crowdsourced curation of articles and learning materials. Licensing such resources for reuse and adaptation allows us to build on what others have done and update resources. Collaborating with students allows emergent, student-centered, and student-guided approaches as we learn together about AI and contribute to societal discussions about its future. We suggest approaching all these modes of response to AI as provisional and subject to reflection and revision with respect to core values and educational philosophies. In this way, we can be quicker and more agile even as the technology continues to change. We give examples of these practices from the Spring of 2023 and call for recognition of their value and for material support for them going forward. These open practices can help us collaborate across institutions, countries, and established power dynamics to enable a richer, more justly distributed emerging response to AI.

AB  - This work introduces design for a Generative AI (Gen-AI) based tutoring system customized for Egyptian community schools needs. Community schools are managed by NGOs as an alternative education to unprivileged students who missed the formal government education. Our research involved working with an Egyptian NGO and a community school in upper Egypt from March 2023 to September 2023. Several workshops were conducted with involved stakeholders and end users to collect the requirements for such a system. The proposed design reflects the views of management, teachers and student parents.It also adhere to Haman-Centered AI (HCAI) principles which prioritize human values and experiences. This paper lists the outcomes of this process and surveys potential tools that can be used in this system. The findings emphasize the need for Gen-AI to act as a teacher's assistant rather than a replacement, it also highlights the need for localization as well as the need for an end-to-end solution rather than developing an isolated AI-based module. The proposed Gen-AI tutoring system integrates Generative AI, a Learning Management System (LMS), and comprehensive reporting dashboards. This design aims to meet the technical and pedagogical requirements of community school environments and produces a trusted tutoring system that empowers teachers and students.

AB  - Recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have created a paradigm shift in multiple areas of society, and the use of these technologies is likely to become a defining feature of education in coming decades. GenAI offers transformative pedagogical opportunities, while simultaneously posing ethical and academic challenges. Against this backdrop, we outline a practical, simple, and sufficiently comprehensive tool to allow for the integration of GenAI tools into educational assessment: the AI Assessment Scale (AIAS). The AIAS empowers educators to select the appropriate level of GenAI usage in assessments based on the learning outcomes they seek to address. The AIAS offers greater clarity and transparency for students and educators, provides a fair and equitable policy tool for institutions to work with, and offers a nuanced approach which embraces the opportunities of GenAI while recognising that there are instances where such tools may not be pedagogically appropriate or necessary. By adopting a practical, flexible approach that can be implemented quickly, the AIAS can form a much-needed starting point to address the current uncertainty and anxiety regarding GenAI in education. As a secondary objective, we engage with the current literature and advocate for a refocused discourse on GenAI tools in education, one which foregrounds how technologies can help support and enhance teaching and learning, which contrasts with the current focus on GenAI as a facilitator of academic misconduct.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of higher education, offering novel opportunities for personalised learning and innovative assessment methods. This paper explores the dual-edged nature of GenAI’s integration into educational practices, focusing on both its potential to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes and the significant challenges it poses to academic integrity and equity. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we examine the implications of GenAI on assessment practices, highlighting the need for robust ethical frameworks to guide its use. Our analysis is framed within pedagogical theories, including social constructivism and competency-based learning, highlighting the importance of balancing human expertise and AI capabilities. We also address broader ethical concerns associated with GenAI, such as the risks of bias, the digital divide, and the environmental impact of AI technologies. This paper argues that while GenAI can provide substantial benefits in terms of automation and efficiency, its integration must be managed with care to avoid undermining the authenticity of student work and exacerbating existing inequalities. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations for educational institutions, including developing GenAI literacy programmes, revising assessment designs to incorporate critical thinking and creativity, and establishing transparent policies that ensure fairness and accountability in GenAI use. By fostering a responsible approach to GenAI, higher education can harness its potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity and inclusive education.

AB  - In the era of transformative technologies, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) offers profound opportunities and challenges for education. This study explores the development and execution of an interactive workshop designed to equip educators with foundational genAI literacy. Using a design-based research (DBR) framework, the workshop leverages interactivity and contextual relevance to introduce genAI concepts, prompting strategies and ethical considerations. Participants engaged in a scripted learning workshop design, comparing human and AI responses, exploring genAI’s probabilistic foundations, context dependency, and vulnerability to manipulation. Conducted across 12 workshops with 191 participants in Austria, this study revealed significant improvements in self-perceived genAI understanding, with 70% of participants reporting better grades in post-assessment evaluations. Feedback emphasized the workshop’s strengths in interactivity and relevance, alongside recommendations for deeper school-specific applications. Scalability analysis showed that workshop duration remained consistent regardless of group size, suggesting potential for broader implementation. The findings highlight the effectiveness of scripted learning workshop design in fostering critical AI literacy, preparing educators to critically evaluate and ethically integrate genAI into pedagogical practices. This adaptable model contributes to the discourse on professional development in AI-enhanced education.

AB  - The transformative influence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), notably large language models (LLMs), has significantly reshaped the software engineering (SE) landscape, impacting various aspects of software development within industry and academia. The imperative to integrate generative AI into educational programs arises from the necessity to furnish graduates with contemporary methodologies that enhance software quality and streamline development processes. Nevertheless, a research gap exists concerning the systematic integration of established SE education guidelines with specific course contexts to strengthen SE education through incorporating generative AI. In response to this gap, our study presents a vision for integrating generative AI into SE education, with a particular emphasis on practical integration strategies aimed at endowing students with essential competencies tailored for contemporary software development. Aligning our vision with the knowledge domains within SE education, we delineate its application across specific areas such as code generation, auto test case completion, and others. The overall objective of these proposed initiatives is to furnish students in SE with an updated and immersive learning experience, thereby addressing the evolving demands of the field.

AB  - Willingness to communicate (WTC) has been identified as a crucial factor in improving EFL learners' speaking. However, enhancing WTC often remains a major challenge. The recent emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded for its transformative potential, yet there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding how this development influences WTC. To address this, our pioneering study investigates the impact of two major AI tools on EFL learners from China, one involving a chatbot and the other an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). 82 first-year undergraduates participated in the study and were assigned to two groups: the AI chatbot group and the ITS group. Pre- and post-session WTC questionnaires, reflection journals and a teacher interview were conducted to collect data. Results revealed significant disparities in WTC changes among the groups. Specifically, the chatbot group displayed significant improvements, while the WTC of the ITS group surprisingly declined. The study delves into the reasons behind these contrasting performances. It concludes by proposing practical implications based on the findings.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are emerging as a critical technological capability of the 21st century and have been spreading their influence in various fields of education, including early childhood education (ECE) in recent years. When properly used and thoughtfully integrated into teaching, AI can be a powerful and effective tool in the classroom, not only to provide inspiration, generate ideas and encourage creativity for both children and teachers, but most importantly to prepare them for a future where technology plays an increasingly important role in schooling. For early childhood educators, AI can also be a tremendous assistant as an administrative helper, idea generator or data organizer, helping teachers to think outside the box and prepare for teaching more creatively and effectively. It appears that there is a growing need for early childhood educators to have not only pedagogical expertise but also a strong foundation in AI literacy, and that pre-service teachers need to be equipped with the ability to use AI appropriately in their formative or undergraduate stages. Therefore, this study aims to explore the ability of early childhood education students to use AI in the creation of picture books for young children, and seeks to provide insights into the potential strengths, weaknesses and ethical issues of integrating AI into early childhood education undergraduate course.

AB  - The rapid development of generative AI (GenAI) technologies in recent years has enabled new opportunities as well as new challenges in higher education. While many studies in computer science have focused on GenAI in programming education, fewer have examined its possibilities and challenges in requirements engineering (RE). This study aims to explore the impact of GenAI on the pedagogical aspects of RE in higher education, focusing on the student perspective, to analyse how GenAI might influence learning experiences, knowledge acquisition, and skill development. The main research question to answer was: "What are the students’ perspectives of the integration of GenAI in the educational practices of requirements engineering?" An Action research strategy was employed, with one of the authors also serving as teacher in the investigated course. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data from workshops and surveys. During the workshops, students used ChatGPT to generate and evaluate software requirements and compared these to manually crafted requirements. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data captured students’ perspectives, while survey data identified trends and preferences. Findings show that while students generally had a positive experience with GenAI, valuing its efficiency and the quality of generated requirements, they also recognized the need for human oversight to maintain accuracy. The study highlights both opportunities and challenges of using GenAI in RE education. While GenAI increased learning engagement and helped with brainstorming, students faced difficulties in creating effective prompts and found it time-consuming to refine AI-generated requirements. A hybrid approach, combining AI-generated and manually created requirements, proved most effective by balancing AI's advantages with human insights. Further research is needed on how GenAI could be effectively integrated into computer science education.

AB  - Research notes that knowledge in student use of generative AI (GenAI) products will be needed by students in their professional careers and will contribute to professional growth. However, we did not find scientific publications that examined students' points of view regarding employers' expectations about the level of students' skills in the field of generative AI. Based on the survey of 689 students from one Ukrainian university, the study examines the students' perspectives on employers' expectations regarding their ability to select and apply generative AI products. The results obtained are compared with a survey of teachers at this university, as well as with a survey of students at Latvian universities. The study also used methods of comparative analysis, descriptive statistics, and econometric methods. We found that only 54% of students believe that employers will soon expect university graduates to have the knowledge and skills to select and effectively use GenAI products. We also examined differences in student responses based on department affiliation, mode of study, program of study, age, gender, and use of GenAI in the educational process. However, a statistically significant association was found only between students' opinions on whether employers will expect AI knowledge from potential employees and the students' use of AI in their study process. Based on the Expectancy-Value Theory, we draw an important conclusion that serves as a signal to university administrators and educators: to better prepare students for the demands of the labor market, it is necessary to appropriately motivate and stimulate them to use GenAI in their educational process.

AB  - The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools in higher education, particularly among university students, has raised ethical concerns regarding unintentional plagiarism. Although these tools offer benefits such as time-saving and improved quality, with over 100 available applications, they may inadvertently include borrowed content, posing challenges to academic integrity. Ethical concerns arise within educational institutions, faculty, and integrity committees, complicating evaluations of originality. To address these concerns, universities must establish clear guidelines and educational programs for responsible use of GenAI applications. Educators need to remain current with the latest AI technologies, become proficient in their use, and utilize advanced techniques to teach students how to use them appropriately. This mixed-methods study examines undergraduate engineering students' understanding of GenAI, its usage and ethical implications. The findings demonstrate that ChatGPT is the most popular GenAI application among the students, but also highlight the professors' unfavorable attitudes towards GenAI. The study endeavors to improve understanding of perspectives on GenAI in higher education, facilitating responsible technology integration in classrooms and fostering students' ethical growth. The investigation provides valuable insights for professors, institutions, and research communities engaged in student development and educational advancement. This study also shows a panorama of strategies that could be implemented by teachers to incorporate GenAI in higher education.

This includes specialized AI-powered technologies tailored for education and general AI-based technologies, including recently popular generative AI tools that stakeholders are increasingly adapting for teaching and learning. Integrating AI tools into educational settings holds numerous potential pedagogical benefits, such as assisting teachers in planning lessons, promoting personalization, and enhancing student autonomy. However, concerns about bias and discrimination linked to the use of these technologies have rapidly emerged. Today, standardized evaluation criteria to assess the potential contribution of such tools to education and their reliability within the learning and teaching context are lacking. To address this gap, we build on an existing taxonomy for the evaluation of open educational resources (OER) to better suit the unique features of generative AI. The result is a six-dimensional evaluation approach that includes descriptive, pedagogical, representational, communication, scientific content, as well as the ethical and transparency dimension. We then apply this approach to examine the educational potential and ethical concerns around 30 AI tools. The analysis facilitates a critical mapping of the potential and risks of AI-powered technologies in education settings.

AB  - This study investigates the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) tools into educational practices, specifically focusing on the design of Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) lesson plans. Based on a particular IBL framework that synthesizes the core attributes of IBL by combining the strengths of various models, the study explores educators' potential utilization of GenAI tools across the framework's phases. Among other capabilities, GenAI tools were examined for their support in content creation, assessment and feedback processes, as well as in the design of learning activities and lesson plans. This examination informed the classification of GenAI tools in this study, organizing them according to their potential utility for educators. These groups and subgroups of tools were then aligned with each phase of the IBL framework, demonstrating their role in achieving the objectives of each phase. Several practical examples across different grade levels and disciplines were also provided to highlight their prospective use. The systematic classification of GenAI tools introduced in this study fills a notable gap in the literature, thus making a valuable contribution to the field of GenAI in education. Additionally, by demonstrating how this classification can be applied as educators craft and deliver IBL lesson plans, the study further contributes by providing guidance on the effective use of these tools in real-world educational contexts.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) offers advanced tools that can personalize learning experiences and enhance teachers’ research capabilities. This paper explores the beliefs of 425 university teachers regarding the integration of generative AI in educational settings, utilizing the UTAUT2 model to predict their acceptance and usage patterns through the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method. The findings indicate that performance expectations, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation all positively impact the intention and behavior related to the use of AIEd. Notably, the study reveals that teachers with constructivist pedagogical beliefs are more inclined to adopt AIEd, underscoring the significance of considering teachers’ attitudes and motivations for the effective integration of technology in education. This research provides valuable insights into the factors influencing teachers’ decisions to embrace AIEd, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of technology integration in educational contexts. Moreover, the study’s results emphasize the critical role of teachers’ pedagogical orientations in their acceptance and utilization of AI technologies. Constructivist educators, who emphasize student-centered learning and active engagement, are shown to be more receptive to incorporating AIEd tools compared to their transmissive counterparts, who focus on direct instruction and information dissemination. This distinction highlights the need for tailored professional development programs that address the specific beliefs and needs of different teaching philosophies. Furthermore, the study’s comprehensive approach, considering various dimensions of the UTAUT2 model, offers a robust framework for analyzing technology acceptance in education.

AB  - Generative AI tools are becoming more widely available and have increasing functionality. Students are beginning to integrate AI into their current practice and will need to be able to ethically use AI in their future careers. Instead of banning AI in an undergraduate biomedical instrumentation instructional laboratory course at a large public university, it was intentionally added with awareness of privacy, equity, and accountability. An assignment was adapted to walk students through comparing data analysis by hand, with mathematical software, and with generative AI. The goal of the updated assignment was for students to be able to think critically about the difference between doing analysis by hand, with purpose-built and validated software, and with a generic tool based on a large language model. The submitted post-lab assignments were analyzed by the research team to understand the students&#x0027; approach to this assignment and what they learned about each method. All the students were able to complete the assignment, however there was mixed feedback on the usefulness of the assignment. Details about the assignment development and analysis of student work on the assignment are included in this paper.

AB  - The present study explores the effects of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in EFL classrooms on student motivation and writing efficacy. Motivation was measured through three components: Ideal L2 Self (IL2), Ought-to L2 Self (OL2), and L2 Learning Experience (L2LE). Participants (n = 327) were first and second-year undergraduate students at a Japanese university, enrolled in mandatory English classes focused on reading/writing or speaking/listening. The control group (n = 164) received peer feedback, whereas the treatment group (n = 163) utilized ChatGPT with specially crafted prompts for feedback. Both groups completed pre- and post-questionnaires to assess motivation and writing self-efficacy. Results affirmed that ChatGPT positively affected students’ motivation related to Ideal L2 Self and L2 Learning Experience. ChatGPT also significantly enhanced writing self-efficacy, which was found to correlate with all three motivational factors. However, there was no impact on Ought-to L2 Self motivation. The study highlights that ChatGPT’s integration can improve intrinsic motivation and writing self-efficacy, provided structured guidance is available to manage issues such as plagiarism. Future research should examine diverse samples, long-term effects, and ChatGPT’s impact on other language skills.

AB  - Generative AI assistants are AI-powered applications that can provide personalized responses to user queries or prompts. A variety of AI assistants have recently been released, and among the most popular is OpenAI's ChatGPT. In this work-in-progress in innovative practice, we explore evidence-based learning strategies and the integration of Generative AI for computer science and engineering education. We expect this research will lead to innovative pedagogical approaches to enhance undergraduate computer science and engineering education. In particular, we describe how ChatGPT was used in two computing-based courses: a Junior-level course in database systems and a Senior-level class in mobile application development. We identify four evidence-based learning strategies: well-defined learning goals, authentic learning experiences, structured learning progression, and strategic assessment. We align these strategies with the two aforementioned courses and evaluate the usefulness of ChatGPT specifically in achieving the learning goals. Combining Generative AI with evidence-based learning has the potential to transform modern education into a more personalized learning experience.

TI  - There’s a crack in everything – especially in ChatGPT: Analyzing the frictions within generative AI integration into a higher education context
LA  - eng
PY  - 2025
AB  - The general accessibility of generative AI in the form of ChatGPT has opened for the educational sector to - at least partly - engage in experimentation about how to integrate this technology in everyday teaching-learning practices. Beyond overly simplistic views that either herald its advantages for personalize learning and the likes, or condemning it as unacademic, such experimentations allow for an exploration of the multi-layered nature and messiness of the situation, where educators and students alike grapple with acts of sensemaking about this pervasive technology (e.g., Vallis et al., 2023). In the wake of such experimentations, the notion arises that what the enmeshment of generative AI with (higher) education elicits are tensions (Cain, 2023), controversial sentiments (Papyshev, 2024) or even frictions (De Groot et al., 2024). Far from a merely cognitivist application of the term (Chen & Schmidt, 2024), we are using the lens of frictions to analyze the messiness and underlying ambiguities that the infusion of generative AI into the educational process has brought about. For that, we are applying the feminist-inspired methodology of a frictional analysis (Puar, 2012; Staunæs & Pors, 2015) to a corpus of material gathered during a small-scale educational experiment in the fall semester of 2023. A cohort of students in a pedagogical program at a Danish university engaged in an open-ended exploration of their own and their peers emerging generative AI-practices, which were documented through written assignments and during a focus-group interview. In addition, we recorded and transcribed our own discussion of these materials, thus supplementing and juxtaposing the student perspective with our respective roles as educator, educational developer and edtech researcher. By reading the material frictionally through two ostensibly contrasting theories, it becomes obvious that generative AI exists as at the same time both, an education policy object that elicits the urge to be shaped, molded and translated into the existing educational rationale (Czarniawska & Joerges 1996), and a site of affective intensities (Staunæs, 2016) that activate across and liquidify the various identities and technologies involved in the endeavor of establishing learning for an AI-mediated world.

AB  - We analyzed the communication patterns of Cipherbot, an educational AI chatbot that addresses validation and transparency problems in AI-student interaction, with 44 undergraduate business students using the system. Findings show that Cipherbot delivers information grounded in learning materials, primarily focusing on statements of fact, with a 99% occurrence rate. Also, about a third (31%) of Cipherbot's messages to students contain an example, which adheres to pedagogical best practices. However, more than a third (36%) of Cipherbot's communication with students also contained traces of opinion, particularly normative statements about how companies or individuals should behave. Cipherbot also demonstrates some level of social etiquette, using thank yous and apologies (7%), but it rarely engages in requests for information, or clarifications and comprehension checks-as these categories might be useful for student engagement, future exploration into diversifying Cipherbot's communication style to support learning is required. Student feedback suggests that usability issues in educational AI chatbots comprise both communicational and technical issues, e.g., incompleteness and redundancy-iterative testing of prompts with student feedback could address many of these challenges. Based on our findings, we make six propositions about students' interaction with educational AI chatbots.

AB  - Despite the growing body of research exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in educational contexts, there remains a critical gap in understanding the specific effects of generative AI (GAI) on English language learning, particularly within higher education in Thailand. This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and Kendall–Theil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (ρ = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (ρ = −.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking.

AB  - Abstract Engineering Technology education stands at the precipice of a profound transformation driven by the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI). Incorporating generative AI into engineering technology education can enhance the learning experience, foster creativity, and prepare students for the increasingly AI-driven field of engineering. It allows students to focus on problem-solving, innovation, and the application of engineering principles, while AI handles routine tasks and provides valuable insights and guidance. However, it's crucial to strike a balance and ensure that students also develop a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts and skills that underlie the technology they are using. This abstract provides an overview of a study that explores the transformative potential and application of Generative AI in engineering technology education. Generative AI refers to a category of AI models and algorithms that have the ability to generate new content that is similar to, or in some cases indistinguishable from, content created by humans. These AI systems are designed to generate data, such as text, images, audio, and more, based on patterns and knowledge they've learned from large datasets during their training. Integrating Generative AI into engineering education can be a valuable way to prepare students for the future and equip them with skills relevant to emerging technologies. This study explores how Generative AI can revolutionize the traditional pedagogical approach by enabling the development of interactive lab experiences, simulations, and practical exercises to integrate and create a greater understanding of AI capabilities. These innovations create authentic learning environments, equipping students with hands-on experience and honing their problem-solving skills. This study also scrutinizes the ethical implications and challenges tied to the incorporation of Generative AI in education. It emphasizes the need for unbiased AI algorithms and responsible usage while calling for comprehensive training and support for instructors in harnessing this innovative technology.

AB  - Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.

AB  - In designing an intelligent tutoring system, a core area of the application of AI in education, tips from the system or virtual tutors are crucial in helping students solve difficult questions in disciplines like mathematics. Traditionally, the manual design of general tips by teachers is time-consuming and error-prone. Generative AI, like ChatGPT, presents a new channel for designing general tips. This study utilized prompt engineering and Chain of Thought to summarize general tips for given mathematical problems (one geometry problem and one algebra problem) and their solutions. A Turing test was conducted to compare ChatGPT-generated general tips with human-designed ones. Results from 121 human evaluators, each assessing 6 ChatGPT-generated and 6 human-designed general tips for each of two mathematical problems, showed that the average score for ChatGPT-generated tips is less than that of human-designed tips at a statistically significant level (p < 0.05), and Zero-Shot CoT achieved the best score. However, no evaluator could distinguish the tip types exactly. The average precision, recall and F-value of all ChatGPT-generated tips are less than 40%. AI-generated general tips can serve as a valuable reference for teachers to enhance efficiency and students’ mathematical learning.

AB  - Subjective understanding is a complex process that involves the interplay of feelings and cognition. This paper explores how computers can monitor a user’s sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity in real-time to detect the nature of the understanding the user is experiencing as they engage with study materials. By leveraging advancements in facial expression analysis, transdermal optical imaging, and voice analysis, I demonstrate how one can identify the physiological feelings that indicate a user’s mental state and level of understanding. The mental state model, which views understandings as composed of assembled beliefs, values, emotions, and feelings, provides a framework for understanding the multifaceted nature of the emotion–cognition relationship. As learners progress through the phases of nascent understanding, misunderstanding, confusion, emergent understanding, and deep understanding, they experience a range of cognitive processes, emotions, and physiological responses that can be detected and analyzed by AI-driven assessments. Based on the above approach, I further propose the development of Abel Tutor. This AI-driven system uses real-time monitoring of physiological feelings to provide individualized, adaptive tutoring support designed to guide learners toward deep understanding. By identifying the feelings associated with each phase of understanding, Abel Tutor can offer targeted interventions, such as clarifying explanations, guiding questions, or additional resources, to help students navigate the challenges they encounter and promote engagement. The ability to detect and respond to a student’s emotional state in real-time can revolutionize the learning experience, creating emotionally resonant learning environments that adapt to individual needs and optimize educational outcomes. As we continue to explore the potential of AI-driven assessments of subjective understanding, it is crucial to ensure that these technologies are grounded in sound pedagogical principles and ethical considerations, ultimately empowering learners and facilitating the attainment of deep understanding and lifelong learning for advantaged and disadvantaged students.

AB  - This study explores the holistic integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, addressing significant gaps in empirical research on AI and EFL. Drawing on existing literature on the ecological views of AI in education, the study conceptualizes holistic integration as a balanced interaction among teachers, students, and AI technologies, enhancing rather than replacing traditional human interactions in pedagogy through mediating teacher-student interactions. The research utilized a mixed-method approach to investigate AI's impact on EFL students' proficiency and perceptions in teacher-led classrooms. 66 Participants from an eastern Chinese city were sampled and divided into an experimental group using AI tools and a control group following traditional education methods. Quantitative results from descriptive and inferential tests revealed that the students who learnt with AI-mediated teacher-student interactions achieved significantly better proficiency than those who did not. Moreover, qualitative findings highlighted that students believe in the effects of holistically integrating AI in EFL education for it (1) facilitated the collaboration among teachers, students and AI, (2) enhanced students' learning motivation, and (3) better fitted their learning preferences. The study concludes that the holistic approach of AI integration in EFL education can optimize EFL learning by leveraging AI's technological benefits and maintaining essential human interaction, indicating a collaborative, instead of a replacing, view of the AI-induced educational reformation. This research underscores the need for strategic AI integration that respects teachers' pedagogical roles, promotes student engagement and enhances students' learning experiences with cultural consideration.

AB  - The Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) has gained widespread acceptance in higher education as an effective pedagogical strategy. Despite its success, the FCM still faces persistent concerns, including a lack of personalized interaction, limited application to introductory courses, and insufficient analysis of the learning process. The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) with the Metaverse may significantly enrich and revitalize FCM by introducing affordances that support personalized and immersive learning experiences. This study examined the potential of FCM enhanced by an AI-Generated Metaverse (AIGM) to improve learning outcomes in higher education. Through introducing an AI-powered virtual tutor, this study aimed to address existing concerns and shed light on the nature of knowledge-building interactions between students and the AI tutor. The study involved 94 university graduates who participated in an experimental FCM session. Data on students’ learning performance were collected through pre/posttests, pre-class video engagement, and analyzed dialogic interactions between students and the AI virtual tutor. The findings indicated that the AIGM-FCM positively influenced learners’ academic performance. Interaction patterns revealed that students predominantly engaged with the AI virtual tutor at the onset and at the end of their learning sessions, primarily for the purpose of asking questions. However, the educational dialogues suggested that the depth of collaborative knowledge construction between students and the AI tutor remained at a basic level. Notably, students with lower academic performance were more likely to initiate inquiry-based dialogues with the AI tutor compared to their higher-achieving peers exhibiting a more focusing-oriented approach. In light of these discussions, the implications of this study are also deliberated.

AB  - The bulk of recent research on generative AI (GenAI) in education mainly focused on its potential pedagogical uses as well as how students actually exploit such tools during learning, while little has been done to systematically investigate how teachers integrate those tools in different parts of their teaching process. To bridge this gap, the present study conducted in-depth interviews with 17 university English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in mainland China, and scrutinized their different phases of teaching for any GenAI involvement. Through the lens of the ADDIE model (i.e., analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation), it was found that GenAI tools were mainly involved in the development stage (e.g., devising teaching activities and developing teaching materials). During the implementation stage, teachers merely introduced GenAI tools to their students, through means such as demonstrations and workshops, indicating a lack of organic integration of those tools into curriculum-based activities. GenAI involvement in the other three stages of instruction was reported to be none to minimal. The participants also shared both positive and negative experiences with GenAI in their EFL instruction. These findings highlight the urgent need for providing stage-specific professional training on how to integrate GenAI into different instructional stages and developing specialized educational GenAI programs that can produce accurate and high-quality outputs. Other implications for incorporating GenAI into education are also discussed.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) could encourage simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and even decision-making. Previous studies noted the importance of assessing the use of technology in education considering its potential implications in the student’s learning and development processes. Hence, this study explored the potential implications of AI particularly in science, mathematics, and technical-vocational education. Educators (n=20) were purposively sampled to be interviewed about their experiences in using AI in their classrooms. The findings suggested a positive perception of generative AI among educators, with many acknowledging its potential to enhance educational practices and outcomes especially in aiding the understanding science concepts, facilitating analytical skills development, and personalizing learning experiences. However, alongside their positive perceptions, educators expressed concerns about potential drawbacks associated with AI use in education. These concerns included the risk of overreliance, plagiarism, and inaccuracies in AI-generated content. To mitigate these negative impacts, educators emphasized the importance of implementing effective policies and guidelines for AI use in classrooms such as guiding students on ethical use, ensuring transparency in AI tool usage, and establishing clear instructions for ethical AI utilization. Transparency emerged as a key theme, with educators emphasizing the need for transparency regarding students' outputs and the extent of AI use. This study calls for further analysis about the level of acceptance of educators in AI use and assess its impacts on students’ short-term and long-term learning outcomes.

AB  - Interleaved practice enhances the memory and problem-solving ability of students in undergraduate courses. We introduce a personalized learning tool built on a Large Language Model (LLM) that can provide immediate and personalized attention to students as they complete homework containing problems interleaved from undergraduate physics courses. Our tool leverages the dimensional analysis method, enhancing students' qualitative thinking and problem-solving skills for complex phenomena. Our approach combines LLMs for symbolic regression with dimensional analysis via prompt engineering and offers students a unique perspective to comprehend relationships between physics variables. This fosters a broader and more versatile understanding of physics and mathematical principles and complements a conventional undergraduate physics education that relies on interpreting and applying established equations within specific contexts. We test our personalized learning tool on the equations from Feynman's lectures on physics. Our tool can correctly identify relationships between physics variables for most equations, underscoring its value as a complementary personalized learning tool for undergraduate physics students.

AB  - This study explores and compares learners' interactions with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within an educational game context. Data from 365 dialogues were collected from 76 K12 students at a middle school in Suzhou, China, who had conversations with GenAI agents in an educational game environment. Drawing upon a framework adapted from the classification system of learners' online asynchronous discussions, six categories were utilized: social and affective (ES), information (Inf), questions (Q&A), ideas (ID), agency (EA), and meta-recapitulation (MA). The study revealed several important findings. Firstly, students' responses contained less information (Inf) and meta-recapitulation (MA) due to the limitations of GenAI in providing authoritative and external resources of information. Secondly, players' social and affective outputs (ES) were associated with mixed emotions, with the majority of emotions experienced by the students being negative (82.02%), and the reasons behind these negative emotions include mistrust of GenAI during or prior to the game, GenAI misinterpreting players' ideas, a mismatch with players' expectations, and GenAI repeatedly outputting the same text. Overall, this study sheds light on the complex dynamics of learners' dialogues with GenAI in educational environment, highlighting the learning opportunities and challenges for improving AI-driven educational experiences.

AB  - Background/purpose. Despite the rapid assimilation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into education, and initial evidence suggesting its potential in language learning, rigorous empirical investigations into its efficacy for cultivating specific language skills remain limited. This study aimed to address this lacuna by examining the impact of guided chatbot interactions on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ listening and writing skills. Materials/methods. A quasi-experimental design was employed, involving 93 undergraduates enrolled in mandatory EFL courses at a public university. Participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n=48), engaging in 10 weekly researcher-designed GenAI-mediated listening and writing activities, or a comparison group (n=45) following a traditional curriculum with optional chatbot use. Data were collected at three time points: pre-test, immediate post-test, and a delayed follow-up. Additionally, post-test qualitative reflections on chatbot use were garnered. Results. While both groups demonstrated improvement over time, the experimental group reached significantly greater gains in both listening and writing at the immediate post-test compared to the control group. However, these advantages were not maintained at the follow-up assessment. Thematic analysis revealed that students valued the personalized and immediate feedback offered by the chatbots, yet expressed concerns about inconsistent content quality, occasional repetition, and the need for clearer task structures. Conclusion. Overall, the findings suggest that targeted GenAI-mediated EFL activities can facilitate short-term improvements in listening and writing performance. Future research is advised to investigate approaches for sustaining these gains, optimizing content generation, and refining the user experience to better support second language learners’ long-term development.

AB  - This essay accounts for a novel way to explore generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications for digital methods research, based on the AI Methodology Map. The map is a pedagogical resource and a theoretical framework designed to structure, visually represent, and explore GenAI web-based applications. As an external object, the map functions as a valuable teaching material and interactive toolkit. As a theoretical framework, it is embodied in a static representation that provides principles for engaging with GenAI. Aligned with digital methods’ practical, technical, and theoretical foundations, the map facilitates explorations and critical examinations of GenAI and is supported by visual thinking and data practice documentation. The essay then outlines the map principles, its system of methods, educational entry points, and applications. The organization is as follows: First, we review GenAI methods, discussing how to access them, and their current uses in social research and the classroom context. Second, we define the AI Methodology Map and unpack the theory it embodies by navigating through the three interconnected methods constituting it: making room for, repurposing and designing digital methods-oriented projects with GenAI. Third, we discuss how the map bridges GenAI concepts, technicity, applications and the practice of digital methods, exposing its potential and reproducibility in educational settings. Finally, we demonstrate the AI Methodology Map’s application, employing a digital methodology to analyze algorithmic race stereotypes in image collections generated by nine prominent GenAI apps. In conclusion, the essay unveils methodological challenges, presenting provocations and critiques on repurposing GenAI for social research. By encompassing practice, materiality and theoretical perspective, we argued that the AI Methodology Map bridges theoretical and empirical engagement with GenAI, serving them together or separately, thus framing the essay’s main contribution. We expect that the AI Methodology Map’s reproducibility will likely lead to further discussions, expanding those we present here.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) has been integrated into foreign language (FL) education, learners' well-being is influenced by various factors, including technological, personal and contextual elements. However, few studies explored how external and internal factors jointly shape FL learners' well-being in the era of generative AI. To fill this gap, this study explores the effects of generative AI acceptance, perceived teachers' enthusiasm and self-efficacy on FL learners' well-being by investigating 613 university learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). The structural equation modelling results reveal that (1) generative AI acceptance positively predicts EFL learners' well-being and self-efficacy; (2) perceived teachers' enthusiasm does not predict learners' well-being and positively predicts EFL learners' self-efficacy; and (3) the self-efficacy for receptive skills mediates the relationship between generative AI acceptance/perceived teachers' enthusiasm and EFL learners' well-being, whereas self-efficacy for productive skills does not play the mediation role. This research broadens the understanding of the antecedents of EFL learners' well-being and extends the application of self-efficacy theory in the AI-driven educational environment, providing significant pedagogical implications.

AB  - Large language models like ChatGPT can learn in-context (ICL) from examples. Studies showed that, due to ICL, ChatGPT achieves impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses ChatGPT's effectiveness in annotating a dataset for training instructor models in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). The task of an ITS instructor model is to automatically provide effective tutoring instruction given a student's state, mimicking human instructors. These models are typically implemented as hardcoded rules, requiring expertise, and limiting their ability to generalize and personalize instructions. These problems could be mitigated by utilizing machine learning (ML). However, developing ML models requires a large dataset of student states annotated by corresponding tutoring instructions. Using human experts to annotate such a dataset is expensive, time-consuming, and requires pedagogical expertise. Thus, this study explores ChatGPT's potential to act as a pedagogy expert annotator. Using prompt engineering, we created a list of instructions a tutor could recommend to a student. We manually filtered this list and instructed ChatGPT to select the appropriate instruction from the list for the given student's state. We manually analyzed ChatGPT's responses that could be considered incorrectly annotated. Our results indicate that using ChatGPT as an annotator is an effective alternative to human experts. The contributions of our work are (1) a novel dataset annotation methodology for the ITS, (2) a publicly available dataset of student states annotated with tutoring instructions, and (3) a list of possible tutoring instructions.

AB  - The intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and education is transforming learning and teaching, with Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) offering new possibilities. AI and LLMs personalize learning through adaptive study guides, instant feedback, automated grading, and content creation, making resources more accessible and tailored to individual needs. Notably, LLM-based chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, serve as virtual assistants, ideal for language practice. However, these chatbots often limit themselves to teaching vocabulary through role-playing conversations or providing instant feedback based on model-generated content, which may lead to exposure to inaccuracies. This overlooks the holistic nature of Language Learning (LL), which requires pedagogy, effective methods, reliable content, and a supportive teacher-student relationship. Therefore, relying on a single chatbot is inefficient for the entire learning process. In this paper, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) is proposed, where each agent specializes in a specific function, working together to provide personalized, adaptive learning support. This approach breaks down the complex learning process into manageable parts. It employs the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), translated into agent-based modeling and LLMs to create dynamic, tailored learning environments. By simulating interactions similar to human tutoring, this model ensures real-time adjustments to meet each student’s evolving needs. Our project aims to address these limitations by using LL books with robust pedagogical resources as primary references. We focus on teaching Luxembourgish, adding complexity to our challenges as it is a low-resource language, ensuring a holistic learning experience. Our approach employs complex LLM workflows as multi-agent collaborations for reading, conversing, listening, and mastering grammar, based on GPT-4o, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and voice recognition features.

Two research questions were addressed: 1) How do students perceive ChatGPT’s effectiveness in English writing? 2) How can ChatGPT contribute to their writing improvement? The study was conducted at the Mediterranean Institute of Technology (MedTech) in Tunis, Tunisia, during the summer of 2023, comprising 21 female and 29 male participants enrolled in English writing courses across various engineering programs. Data collection was carried out through a questionnaire, designed to gather qualitative and quantitative insights, including a combination of open-ended and 5-scale Likert questions. The survey assessed students’ perceptions of ChatGPT’s effectiveness in various writing aspects and gathered their suggestions for improvement. The results reveal that students find ChatGPT particularly effective in generating ideas and improving grammar. Students appreciate the immediate feedback and suggestions provided by ChatGPT, helping them identify their errors. Additionally, students benefit from ChatGPT’s ability to expand their vocabulary and improve writing fluency. However, students also identified areas where ChatGPT could be improved, such as better understanding contextual nuances and providing more reliable and contextually appropriate suggestions. Students emphasized the importance of balancing ChatGPT’s use as a writing aid with the development of their own critical thinking and creativity in the writing process. These findings contribute to the ongoing development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)-based writing tools, highlighting the importance of balancing technology assistance with students’ independent writing abilities and critical thinking. keywords: artificial intelligence (AI) Integration; Era of artificial intelligence (AI); Higher Education; Learning Experience; OpenAI

Our study examines the adoption of ChatGPT as a mentor for undergraduate computing projects. It explores the impact of ChatGPT mentorship, specifically, skills development, and mentor responsiveness, i.e., ChatGPT's responsiveness to students' needs and requests. We utilize PLS-SEM to investigate the interrelationships between different factors and develop a model that captures their contribution to the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a mentor. The findings suggest that mentor responsiveness and technical/design support are key factors for the adoption of AI tools like ChatGPT. The study provides practical implications for educators seeking to incorporate AI as a mentor to support students doing computing projects and contributes to the broader understanding of the use of AI in education.

AB  - The latest advances in science and technology have resulted in great advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including the creation of chatbots. Chatbots simulate human conversation and allow humans to ask questions and receive answers based on a large volume of electronically stored information. Faculties of universities around the world are trying to come to grips with the availability of AI tools, such as chatbots, and are debating the ethical and moral questions surrounding the use of AI in education. This paper presents the results of a study which intended to answer three research questions. RQ1: how familiar are students with AI and tools that utilize it? RQ2: are students aware of the ethical issues involving AI and are they familiar with the university’s policies regarding the use of AI? RQ3: can ChatGPT be used as an efficient tool to teach science majors to code in Python? In this project, a chatbot was used to instruct students on the use of the Python programming language. Introductory college physics students were tasked with using an AI chatbot, ChatGPT (chat generative pre-trained transformer), to learn how to effectively code in the coding program, Python. Before using ChatGPT to code, the students were given a pre-test survey to determine their skill level in Python coding and their familiarity of AI and issues pertaining the use of AI. After completing exercises in Python coding using ChatGPT, a post-test survey was conducted to determine how well the students have learned to code in Python as well as how effective ChatGPT was in assisting their study.

AB  - Large language models represent a significant advancement in the field of AI. The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.

AB  - In the era of the second revolution of intelligent tutoring systems, the integration of artificial intelligence can bring about a learning process adjusted to the personal needs and preferences of students, including language teaching, sinse AI-based systems can assist in identifying and addressing individual language skills and deficiencies. While these systems can be divided into four inherently AI-based components (learner model, domain model, pedagogical model and user interface) facilitating the embedding of cognitive functions, the options hidden in the integration of big language models have not yet been fully utilized. The first step in the integration of ChatGPT developed by OpenAI is the thorough identification of the goals of the education process followed by the allocation of the appropriate API (Application Programming Interface) service to the given process (question and answer, content summary, sentiment analysis). At the same time it is worthwhile to improve the ITS architecture to maximise the ChatGPT provided options. One result of our research and development effort is a further improved architecture integrating an additional component, the central organizer. This unit is responsible for the matching or allocation of the ChatGPT’s API parameters to the given educational content and objective. The integration of ChatGPT into intelligent tutoring systems poses numerous challenges such as the protection of personal information, the related technological problems along with the clarification of ethical issues (Ara-tó–Balázs 2023). Addressing such concerns is necessary for the realization of our original objective guaranteeing that the respective technological achievement would effectively support the implementation of said goals.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) represents the future of the workforce, but existing curricula inadequately prepare students to comprehend and use these new technologies. Despite the push for educators to teach AI literacy, there is a distinct lack of research exploring student perspectives on the topic. Utilizing an explanatory sequential mixed methods research design, we first administered an AI literacy survey to undergraduate students in a computing major to learn how they think about AI, and then conducted focus group interviews after further refining our research questions. There was a discrepancy between undergraduate competence with AI applications and underlying AI principles, which were conflated on the survey and positively influenced overall knowledge. Participant confidence in AI’s capability as a learning tool was infrequently limited by perception of personal ability, but rather by beliefs about limitations in AI tool efficacy. Participants believed that students pursuing any field would benefit from AI literacy and that AI literacy education, if implemented effectively, could mitigate concerns with AI pervasion in the workplace. A combination of surveys and assessments will be beneficial when centering students in AI curricula, the former establishing a student’s AI confidence and the latter competence.

AB  - This paper explores a novel workflow that integrates Generative AI tools, ChatGPT and DALL·E, into educational use, aiming to improve the traditional teaching methods in university education. Our workflow is focused on creating short introductory videos for university courses, using primary course descriptions available in the university's study guide with the idea of introducing courses visually. This approach was deliberately selected for experimentation, and we believe that it could be further enhanced to generate course videos on specific course topics. This will minimize the efforts of teachers who are required to produce detailed course videos as a part of their teaching. As the first part of our workflow, we present a tool that utilizes ChatGPT-4 and DALL·E 2 to autonomously generate a script and background graphics for videos, using primary course descriptions extracted through a given course web URL. As the second part of the workflow, we combine those generated artefacts into videos using Narakeet, a Text-to-Speech software service that is available online. To analyze the feasibility of this workflow, we then conducted a field survey where university teachers participated in reviewing introductory course videos of their courses generated through our workflow. We employed only engineering courses that are English-taught in this field survey. The results demonstrate the potential of AI-generated content to increase the efficiency of teachers when creating video materials. However, challenges such as the uncanny valley effect in text-to-speech narration and the propensity for AI-generated misinformation highlight the need for careful review by humans on such content before setting it for wider use. This paper argues for the strategic integration of AI in university education, focusing on the benefits, while acknowledging the limitations owned by generative AI tools.

AB  - Debugging is a crucial skill for programmers, yet it can be challenging for novices to learn. The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for providing personalized debugging support to students. However, concerns have been raised about potential student over-reliance on LLM-based tools. This mixed-methods study investigates how a pedagogically-designed LLM-based chatbot supports students' debugging efforts in an introductory programming course. We conducted interviews and debugging think-Aloud tasks with 20 students at three points throughout the semester. We specifically focused on characterizing when students initiate help from the chatbot during debugging, how they engage with the chatbot's responses, and how they describe their learning experiences with the chatbot. By analyzing data from the debugging tasks, we identified varying help-seeking behaviors and levels of engagement with the chatbot's responses, depending on students' familiarity with the suggested strategies. Interviews revealed that students appreciated the content and experiential knowledge provided by the chatbot, but did not view it as a primary source for learning debugging strategies. Additionally, students self-identified certain chatbot usage behaviors as negative, "non-ideal"engagement and others as positive, "learning-oriented"usage. Based on our findings, we discuss pedagogical implications and future directions for designing pedagogical chatbots to support debugging.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), there is a growing opportunity to transform traditional learning methods to create more personalized, interactive, and effective educational experiences that cater to individual learning styles and needs. This pilot study explores the impact of AI technologies on student learning, comparing traditional book learning with AIpowered interactions using LLMs. In a controlled experiment with 27 university students, participants were divided into three equal groups, each exposed to a different learning technique: (1) bookbased learning, (2) LLM-powered interactive typing chat, and (3) LLM-powered virtual agent with voice chat, all containing the same book content. The results showed that the typing chat LLM group achieved the highest knowledge comprehension, outperforming both the book learning and voice chat groups. These findings highlight the potential of AI and LLMs to enhance educational outcomes by providing personalized and interactive learning experiences. This study underscores the importance of integrating AI-powered LLMs into education, paving the way for innovative approaches that leverage technology to improve student learning and retention.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) adults experience a wide variety of unique challenges accessing healthcare. These barriers may be exacerbated among older LGBTQ+ people due to intersecting, marginalized identities. To prepare physicians to address the healthcare needs of older LGBTQ+ adults, graduate medical education (GME) must include training about the specific needs of this population. Prior studies demonstrate a lack of LGBTQ+ training in GME curricula. Here, we investigated the presence of LGBTQ+ curricula in internal medicine residencies and geriatrics fellowships through a national survey. Over 62.0% of internal medicine (n = 49) and 65.6% (n = 21) of geriatric medicine fellowship program directors, responding to the survey, reported content relevant to the health of older LGBTQ+ adults. Education about LGBTQ+ health in internal medicine residencies and geriatrics fellowships is vital for the provision of culturally-competent healthcare and to create an inclusive environment for older LGBTQ+ patients.

AB  - This study explores the impact of ChatGPT, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM), as a virtual tutor in online education across five key dimensions: answering questions, writing assistance, study resources, exam preparation, and availability. Utilizing an experimental design, 68 undergraduate students from a public university interacted with ChatGPT over a 15-week academic semester. Data were collected through a validated questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple regression. Findings reveal that students generally perceive ChatGPT as a valuable tool, with a high mean rating across dimensions such as exam preparation (M = 3.38, SD = 1.26) and availability (M = 3.55, SD = 1.34). The correlation analyses showed significant interdependencies between dimensions, with the highest correlation coefficient observed between writing assistance and exam preparation (Kendall’s tau_b = 0.45, p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis identified writing assistance (β = 0.35, p < 0.01) and exam preparation (β = 0.40, p < 0.01) as significant predictors of overall effectiveness. These findings suggest that ChatGPT’s multiple functionalities do not operate independently but instead complement and reinforce each other, resulting in a more supportive and integrated learning environment. The study's findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs to address the limitations of traditional Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and offer a more comprehensive and personalized approach to online learning support. The study, however, identifies key areas for enhancing the LLM-based learning environment including the need for greater contextual engagement in learning materials and more comprehensive and personalized feedback mechanisms. The implications of these findings and future research directions are further discussed.

AB  - How do students use artificial intelligence tools in coursework projects when given the liberty to do so, with the only requirement of documenting how, where and why? We describe experiences with two groups of undergraduates in courses related to serious game authoring and human-computer interaction, both carried out in the second semester of 2023. In the serious games course, students were given the option of following a teacher-developed methodology for generating graphical assets for their serious games using a set of generative AI tools. This methodology was explained in the class but not hands on lab was carried out. In the interaction course, students were free to choose which AI tools to use when designing their system or in the development of their project documentation. Despite the limited number of participants (41 in total) we can see very different views and degrees of involvement: while some tried to use AI for as many tasks as possible, others considered that the learning curve for those tools was too steep to be worthwhile. Both experiences included a free-text survey at the end, and taken together, provide insights into how both supervised and unsupervised generative AI use could impact undergraduate projects in similar subjects. In addition to describing how students chose to use the tools, and the main takeaways from their survey response, we also discuss some of the ethical aspects about the access to the tools and what should be the minimal conditions to be met to allow the equitable use of AI in the classroom.

AB  - The ability of children to ask curiosity-driven questions is an important skill that helps improve their learning. For this reason, previous research has explored designing specific exercises to train this skill. Several of these studies relied on providing semantic and linguistic cues to train them to ask more of such questions (also called divergent questions). But despite showing pedagogical efficiency, this method is still limited as it relies on generating the said cues by hand, which can be a very long and costly process. In this context, we propose to leverage advances in the natural language processing field (NLP) and investigate the efficiency of using a large language model (LLM) for automating the production of key parts of pedagogical content within a curious question-asking (QA) training. We study generating the said content using the "prompt-based" method that consists of explaining the task to the LLM in natural text. We evaluate the output using human experts annotations and comparisons with hand-generated content. Results suggested indeed the relevance and usefulness of this content. We then conduct a field study in primary school (75 children aged 9–10), where we evaluate children’s QA performance when having this training. We compare 3 types of content: 1) hand-generated content that proposes "closed" cues leading to predefined questions; 2) GPT-3-generated content that proposes the same type of cues; 3) GPT-3-generated content that proposes "open" cues leading to several possible questions. Children were assigned to either one of these groups. Based on human annotations of the questions generated, we see a similar QA performance between the two "closed" trainings (showing the scalability of the approach using GPT-3), and a better one for participants with the "open" training. These results suggest the efficiency of using LLMs to support children in generating more curious questions, using a natural language prompting approach that affords usability by teachers and other users not specialists of AI techniques. Furthermore, results also show that open-ended content may be more suitable for training curious question-asking skills.

AB  - The recent evolution of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has already made a tangible impact within the realm of education. Positioned at the forefront of information and digital literacies, teacher librarians (TLs) can be leaders in exploring the potential for AI platforms to transform learning and teaching. This research is based on an exploratory methodology, to investigate how TLs might teach with and about GAI by applying the CATWOE analysis technique [Checkland, P., & Poulter, J. (2006). Learning for action: A short definitive account of soft systems methodology, and its use for practitioners, teachers and students. Wiley.] within the context of three specific GAI platforms. Findings highlight the multifaceted role that TLs can assume, extending beyond the pedagogical integration of GAI to encompass a broader educational mandate: to scaffold students’ capabilities as critical and ethical users of these tools in the creation and use of information.

This study examines whether class discussions on the negative aspects of AI-driven writing assistance have any impact on mitigating reliance on such technology. To address the inquiry, data were collected from undergraduate students in the U.S. Findings indicate that these discussions lead to a more critical evaluation of ChatGPT’s usefulness and favorability toward it, resulting in weaker intentions to use it. The study underscores the importance of class discussions and offers insights into how instructors and educators can navigate concerns about negative effects of AI-powered technology in education while leveraging the benefits of it.

AB  - As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, concerns exist regarding their accuracy and potential for hallucination. However, few studies evaluate performance systematically across academic contexts. This paper summarizes three case studies assessing LLM accuracy in classroom analytics exercises. In the first, students tested ChatGPT 3.5 responses to technical questions in graduate courses over 12 weeks. Over 95% factual concordance was found, with repetition being the primary inconsistency. The second study successfully replicated 167 statistical analyses from an Excel exercise book in ChatGPT 4 covering techniques like regression and inference. No discernible accuracy issues appeared. The third case evaluated Claude 2 and ChatGPT 4 on Harvard Business School cases and associated questions across four subjects, with student teams finding perfect alignment with faculty provided solutions. Collectively, the case studies reveal three key themes. First, constrained problem scopes limit deviations in accuracy. Second, performance relies on relevant domain exposure during pretraining. Third, high grading agreements position LLMs as credible teaching assistants, though personalization and originality remain inadequate. Contrary to wider benchmarks, LLMs demonstrate high fidelity on academic tasks, allaying concerns about hallucination. Speculatively, restricted interfaces could enhance reliability. Domain-specific finetuning also remains vital. The studies support LLMs' use for automated tutoring and analysis, complementing human educators. Further assessments on more advanced reasoning tasks are still necessary.

AB  - This paper explores the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on teachers’ roles and agencies in education, presenting a comprehensive framework that addresses teachers’ perceptions, knowledge, acceptance, and practices of GenAI. As GenAI technologies, such as ChatGPT, become increasingly integrated into educational settings, both in-service and future teachers are required to adapt to evolving classroom dynamics, where AI plays a significant role in content creation, personalized learning, and student engagement. However, existing literature often treats these factors in isolation, overlooking how they collectively influence teachers’ ability to effectively integrate GenAI into their pedagogical practices. This paper fills this gap by proposing a framework that categorizes teachers (including both pre- and in-service teachers, hereafter) into four roles—Observer, Adopter, Collaborator, and Innovator—each representing different levels of GenAI engagement, outlining teachers’ agencies in GenAI classrooms. By highlighting the need for quality teacher education programs, continuous professional development and institutional support, we use examples to demonstrate how teachers can evolve from basic GenAI users to co-creators of knowledge alongside GenAI systems. The findings emphasize that for GenAI to reach its full educational potential, teachers must not only accept and understand its capabilities but also integrate it deeply into their teaching practices. This study contributes to the growing literature on GenAI in education, offering practical implications for supporting both in-service and future teachers in navigating the complexities of GenAI adoption.

AB  - This study introduces a novel methodology for enhancing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) through the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and specialized AI agents. We present a proof of concept (PoC) demo that implements a dual-layer GenAI validation approach that utilizes multiple large language models to ensure the reliability and pedagogical integrity of the AI-generated content. The system features role-specific AI agents, a GenAI-powered scoring mechanism, and an AI mentor that provides periodic guidance. This approach demonstrates capabilities in dynamic scenario generation and real-time adaptability while addressing key challenges in AI-driven education, such as personalization, scalability, and domain-specific knowledge integration. Although exemplified here through a case study in healthcare root cause analysis, the methodology is designed for broad applicability across various fields. Our findings suggest that this approach has significant potential for advancing adaptive learning and personalized instruction while raising important considerations regarding ethical AI application in education. This work provides a foundation for further research into the efficacy and impact of GenAI-enhanced ITS on learning outcomes and instructional design across diverse educational domains.

AB  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems require student modeling in order to make pedagogical decisions, such as individualized feedback or task selection. Typically, student modeling is based on the eventual correctness of tasks. However, for multi-step or iterative learning tasks, like in programming, the intermediate states towards a correct solution also carry crucial information about learner skill. We investigate how to detect learners who struggle on their path towards a correct solution of a task. Prior work addressed struggle detection in programming environments on different granularity levels, but has mostly focused on preventing course dropout. We conducted a pilot study of our programming learning environment and evaluated different approaches for struggle detection at the task level. For the evaluation of measures, we use downstream Item Response Theory competency models. We find that detecting struggle based on large language model text embeddings outperforms chosen baselines with regard to correlation with a programming competency proxy.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming society, making it crucial to prepare the next generation through AI literacy in K-12 education. However, scalable and reliable AI literacy materials and assessment resources are lacking. To address this gap, our study presents a novel approach to generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for AI literacy assessments. Our method utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate scalable, high-quality assessment questions. These questions align with user-provided learning objectives, grade levels, and Bloom's Taxonomy levels. We introduce an iterative workflow incorporating LLM-powered critique agents to ensure the generated questions meet pedagogical standards. In the preliminary evaluation, experts expressed strong interest in using the LLM-generated MCQs, indicating that this system could enrich existing AI literacy materials and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of K-12 educators.

AB  - At AIED 2022 (Durham), a panel discussion took place in response to a provocation that acknowledged that the work of the AIED community is increasingly being commercialised and that, partly as a consequence, AIED is increasingly being criticised (e.g., for perpetuating poor pedagogic practices, datafication, and introducing classroom surveillance). The provocation went on to ask whether the AIED community should carry on regardless, continuing with its traditional focus, or whether it should seek a new role. As the panel discussion raised many important issues, the panellists were subsequently invited to publish their thoughts in opinion pieces in the IJAIED. To extend the discussion, several leading researchers from outside the community were also invited to contribute. The result was a Special Issue of the IJAIED (“AIED. Coming of age?”, 2023). However, now that some of AIED’s leading community members and some leading researchers from outside the community had had their say, there remained an important gap. What were the thoughts and opinions of the wider membership of the AIED community? This is particularly timely given the recent explosion of AIED tools, particularly due to the now widely available tools based on Large Language Models. This half-day workshop was dedicated to opening up the conversation, so that everyone in the community could have their say, and could contribute to the future of AIED.

AB  - After many years of relatively limited capabilities for generative language models, recent large language models (LLM's) have demonstrated qualitatively better capabilities for understanding, synthesis, and inference on text. Due to the prominence of ChatGPT's chat system, both the media and many educational developers have suggested using generative AI to directly tutor students. However, despite surface-level similarity between ChatGPT interactions and tutoring dialogs, generative AI has other strengths which may be substantially more relevant for intelligent tutoring (e.g., detecting misconceptions, improved language translation, content generation) and weaknesses that make it problematic for on-the-fly tutoring (e.g., hallucinations, lack of pedagogical training data). In this paper, we discuss how we are approaching generative LLM's for tutoring dialogs, for problems such as multiconcept short answer grading and semi-supervised interactive content generation. This work shows interesting opportunities for prompt engineering approaches for short-answer classification, despite sometimes quirky behavior. The time savings for high-quality content generation for tutoring is not yet clear and further research is needed. The paper concludes with a consideration of longer-term equity and access in a world where essential capabilities require low-latency real-time connections to large, pay-peruse models. Risks and mitigating technologies for this kind of “AI digital divide” are discussed, including optimized/edge-computing LLM's and using generative AI models as simulated students to train specialized tutoring models.

AB  - This study explores and analyzes the specific performance of large language models (LLMs) in instructional design, aiming to unveil their potential strengths and possible weaknesses. Recently, the influence of LLMs has gradually increased in multiple fields, yet exploratory research on their application in education remains relatively scarce. In response to this situation, our research, grounded in pedagogical content knowledge theory, initially formulated an instructional design framework based on mathematical problem chains and corresponding prompt instructions. Subsequently, a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM's instructional design capabilities was developed. Utilizing Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, a high school mathematics teaching plan dataset was generated. Finally, the performance of LLMs in instructional design was evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that the teaching plans generated by LLMs excel in setting instructional objectives, identifying teaching priorities, organizing problem chains and teaching activities, articulating subject content, and selecting methods and strategies. Particularly commendable performance was noted in the modules of statistics and functions. However, there is room for improvement in aspects related to mathematical culture and interdisciplinary assessment, as well as in the geometry and algebra modules. Lastly, this study proposes initiatives, such as LLM prompt-based teacher training and the integration of mathematics-focused LLMs. These suggestions aim to advance personalized instructional design and professional development of teachers, offering educators new insights into the in-depth application of LLMs.

AB  - The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the domain of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI, has opened new avenues for application across various fields, yet its role in business education remains underexplored. This study introduces the first benchmark to assess the performance of seven major LLMs—OpenAI's models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4 Turbo), Google's models (PaLM 2, Gemini 1.0 Pro), and Anthropic's models (Claude 2 and Claude 2.1)— on the GMAT, which is a key exam in the admission process for graduate business programs. Our analysis shows that most LLMs outperform human candidates, with GPT-4 Turbo not only outperforming the other models but also surpassing the average scores of graduate students at top business schools. Through a case study, this research examines GPT-4 Turbo's ability to explain answers, evaluate responses, identify errors, tailor instructions, and generate alternative scenarios. The latest LLM versions— GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 2.1, and Gemini 1.0 Pro— show marked improvements in reasoning tasks compared to their predecessors, underscoring their potential for complex problem-solving. While AI's promise in education, assessment, and tutoring is clear, challenges remain. Our study not only sheds light on LLMs' academic potential but also emphasizes the need for careful development and application of AI in education. As AI technology advances, it is imperative to establish frameworks and protocols for AI interaction, verify the accuracy of AI-generated content, ensure worldwide access for diverse learners, and create an educational environment where AI supports human expertise. This research sets the stage for further exploration into the responsible use of AI to enrich educational experiences and improve exam preparation and assessment methods.

PY  - 2023
AB  - Understanding user perspectives on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is essential for creating pedagogically effective and ethically responsible AI-integrated learning environments. In this paper, we conduct an extensive qualitative content analysis of four major social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and LinkedIn) to explore the user experience (UX) and perspectives of early adopters toward ChatGPT-an AI Chatbot technology-in various education sectors. We investigate the primary applications of ChatGPT in education (RQ1) and the various perceptions of the technology (RQ2). Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is most popularly used in the contexts of higher education (24.18%), K-12 education (22.09%), and practical-skills learning (15.28%). On social media platforms, the most frequently discussed topics about ChatGPT are productivity, efficiency, and ethics. While early adopters generally lean toward seeing ChatGPT as a revolutionary technology with the potential to boost students' self-efficacy and motivation to learn, others express concern that overreliance on the AI system may promote superficial learning habits and erode students' social and critical thinking skills. Our study contributes to the broader discourse on Human-AI Interaction and offers recommendations based on crowd-sourced knowledge for educators and learners interested in incorporating ChatGPT into their educational settings. Furthermore, we propose a research agenda for future studies that sets the foundation for continued investigation into the application of ChatGPT in education.

AB  - There is an intense concern in various fields, in order to quantify in the most complete and explicit way the impact that the accelerated development of the technology that is the basis of AI has on education. A very special issue in this context is represented by the impact AI has on the teaching methods and techniques used by teachers. Still, in order to develop and refine new methods and techniques based on AI technology is necessary that perceptions and attitudes toward this technology in general and its application in education in special to become positive and people to be open to new experiences in using it. The present research explores how different variables like perception towards inclusion of Generative AI tools within teaching materials development, degree of familiarity, challenges of AI implementation in education, importance of AI within the teaching process, resilience to change can influence the perceived utility of AI in education fostering positive attitude towards it and usage intention among teachers. The results are showing that the influence exerted by the above variables can be assessed within an empirical model that can explain the intention of teachers to use effectively AI based tools at different levels of the didactic activity. Implications at the level of human resources management in education are also discussed.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are positioned to transform how students interact with data in classroom and laboratory settings, both now and in the future. The integration of LLMs into chemical curricula, if done effectively, may improve student equity and learning outcomes and provide an alternative approach to data analysis alongside traditional methods. One of the key strengths of LLMs is their ability to efficiently summarize large data sets and transform them into understandable forms. Although the ability of LLMs to help students process qualitative data is well established, here we focus on use of LLMs to process quantitative data and, specifically, make high-quality data plots without relying exclusively on spreadsheet skills. Specifically, we tested the ability of OpenAI’s ChatGPT to plot Walsh diagrams relevant to an ongoing laboratory experiment conducted in an undergraduate inorganic chemistry course. It was found that the LLM could generate high-quality graphs from raw data with appropriate prompts. Furthermore, the LLM was able to parse long computational output files to extract relevant data as well as perform multivariate linear regression. A pilot experiment integrating LLMs as a tool to generate graphs from complex data sets into a 300-level inorganic chemistry laboratory showed that ∼60% of the students considered LLMs as an efficient tool for data analysis, ∼40% felt the tool significantly enhanced their learning, and ∼5% experienced frustration. Introducing LLMs as a supplementary tool for data processing could help students who struggle with spreadsheet software without replacing essential spreadsheet skills that are fundamental to training the STEM workforce. Implementation of LLMs as a data processing tool may bring about equitable outcomes in quantitative chemistry courses regardless of students’ prior experience with spreadsheet software.

AB  - In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancement and adoption, and are increasingly being used in educational contexts. In this perspective article, we explore the open challenge of leveraging LLMs to create personalized learning environments that support the “whole learner” by modeling and adapting to both cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics. We identify three key challenges toward this vision: (1) improving the interpretability of LLMs' representations of whole learners, (2) implementing adaptive technologies that can leverage such representations to provide tailored pedagogical support, and (3) authoring and evaluating LLM-based educational agents. For interpretability, we discuss approaches for explaining LLM behaviors in terms of their internal representations of learners; for adaptation, we examine how LLMs can be used to provide context-aware feedback and scaffold non-cognitive skills through natural language interactions; and for authoring, we highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in using natural language instructions to specify behaviors of educational agents. Addressing these challenges will enable personalized AI tutors that can enhance learning by accounting for each student's unique background, abilities, motivations, and socioemotional needs.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has been applied in various aspects of online education to facilitate teaching and learning. However, few approaches have been made towards a complete AI-powered tutoring system. In this work, we explore the development of a full-fledged intelligent tutoring system based on large language models (LLMs). The proposed system ChatTutor, powered by state-of-the-art LLMs, is equipped with automatic course planning and adjusting, informative instruction, and adaptive quiz offering and evaluation. ChatTutor is decomposed into three inter-connected core processes: interaction, reflection, and reaction. Each process is implemented by chaining LLM-powered tools along with dynamically updated memory modules. To demonstrate the mechanism of each working module and the benefits of structured memory control and adaptive reflection, we conduct a wide range of analysis based on statistical results and user study. The analysis shows the designed processes boost system consistency and stability under long-term interaction and intentional disruptions, with up to 5% and 20% increase in performance respectively. Meanwhile, we also compare the system with scripts from real-world online learning platform and discuss the potential issues unique to LLM-based systems.

AB  - According to several international journals, artificial intelligence in education (AIET) is a more recent field in the educational sector. Even though it has been there for close to 30 years, educators are still confused about how to utilize it pedagogically on a larger scale and how it may have a substantial impact on teaching and learning as per SDG-4 Indicator 4.4.1, which tracks the proportion of educators and academia with the necessary information technology skills, putting them on the road to better employment and understanding Education 4.0. This article postulates a review of the impacts of AI in education and briefs the number of published studies in the area of AI in education, which has expanded as a result of the growing usage of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in education. However, extensive evaluations have been conducted to fully study the numerous facets of this topic. This study seeks to address this gap by utilizing PRISMA to detect trends and issues relevant to AI applications in education (AIET) based on publications from 2000 to 2022. The review's findings show that the academic community is becoming more interested in applying AI to education. The primary research questions covered in this study are those related to the origin: Rise in AI, Importance, and Impact of AI on Education Technology, as well as related areas such as intelligent tutoring systems for education AI challenges in the education sector, and future scope of AI and ChatGPT-3 in higher education.

AB  - Objective Examine associations between political diversity, health, and stress in a student sample for whom examining political biases is necessary. Participants: Graduate students in mental health (N = 512) from July 2017 to June 2018. Methods: Participants completed an online survey of political views, health, and stress. Descriptive statistics reported sample characteristics; stepwise regressions tested whether political affiliation and perceived political majority/minority status predicted health and stress. Results: Students identified primarily as liberal, and perceived their counterparts as liberal. Liberal political identification generally predicted more stress and poorer health in several domains; however, those identifying as most politically conservative also reported relatively high stress. Conclusions: Liberal academic environments may relate to stress for those who identify as most politically conservative, while also not protecting liberals against broader sociopolitical stress and related health sequelae. Graduate students in mental health may benefit from increased curricular and supervisory focus on political diversity and related biases.

AB  - Grading assessments is time-consuming and prone to human bias. Students may experience delays in receiving feedback that may not be tailored to their expectations or needs. Harnessing AI in education can be effective for grading undergraduate physics problems, enhancing the efficiency of undergraduate-level physics learning and teaching, and helping students understand concepts with the help of a constantly available tutor. This report devises a simple empirical procedure to investigate and quantify how well large language model (LLM) based AI chatbots can grade solutions to undergraduate physics problems in Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetic Theory and Quantum Mechanics, comparing humans against AI grading. The following LLMs were tested: Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The results show AI grading is prone to mathematical errors and hallucinations, which render it less effective than human grading, but when given a mark scheme, there is substantial improvement in grading quality, which becomes closer to the level of human performance—promising for future AI implementation. Evidence indicates that the grading ability of LLM is correlated with its problem-solving ability. Through unsupervised clustering, it is shown that Classical Mechanics problems may be graded differently from other topics. The method developed can be applied to investigate AI grading performance in other STEM fields.

AB  - Incorporating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), into educational settings presents valuable opportunities to boost the efficiency of educators and enrich the learning experiences of students. A significant portion of the current use of LLMs by educators has involved using conversational user interfaces (CUIs), such as chat windows, for functions like generating educational materials or offering feedback to learners. The ability to engage in real-time conversations with LLMs, which can enhance educators' domain knowledge across various subjects, has been of high value. However, it also presents challenges to LLMs' widespread, ethical, and effective adoption. Firstly, educators must have a degree of expertise, including tool familiarity, AI literacy and prompting to effectively use CUIs, which can be a barrier to adoption. Secondly, the open-ended design of CUIs makes them exceptionally powerful, which raises ethical concerns, particularly when used for high-stakes decisions like grading. Additionally, there are risks related to privacy and intellectual property, stemming from the potential unauthorised sharing of sensitive information. Finally, CUIs are designed for short, synchronous interactions and often struggle and hallucinate when given complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., providing individual feedback based on a rubric on a large scale). To address these challenges, we explored the benefits of transitioning away from employing LLMs via CUIs to the creation of applications with user-friendly interfaces that leverage LLMs through API calls. We first propose a framework for pedagogically sound and ethically responsible incorporation of GenAI into educational tools, emphasizing a human-centred design. We then illustrate the application of our framework to the design and implementation of a novel tool called Feedback Copilot, which enables instructors to provide students with personalized qualitative feedback on their assignments in classes of any size. An evaluation involving the generation of feedback from two distinct variations of the Feedback Copilot tool, using numerically graded assignments from 338 students, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of our approach. Our findings have significant implications for GenAI application researchers, educators seeking to leverage accessible GenAI tools, and educational technologists aiming to transcend the limitations of conversational AI interfaces, thereby charting a course for the future of GenAI in education.

AB  - This work-in-progress study aims to explore and analyze the growing impact of large language models (LLMs) in the fields of education and industry. We preliminarily review how LLMs can be integrated into educational contexts with their technical features, open-source nature, and applicability. Through a systematic search, we have identified a selection of open-source LLMs that have been released or significantly updated post-2021. This initial search indicates a thriving field with immense potential for both academic and industry applications. While LLMs hold promise for education, some challenges need to be addressed. These include limited application of open-source LLMs, concerns regarding data privacy, content accuracy, and potential biases. It is critical to carefully consider these factors before deploying LLMs in educational settings. However, our preliminary research highlights the versatility of LLMs in generating educational content and supporting diverse instructional strategies. This suggests a shift towards more adaptive and personalized learning environments. By assessing the suitability of these models for educational purposes, our study lays the foundation for future research aimed at fully maximizing the potential of open-source LLMs to transform teaching and learning practices. As our work progresses, we plan to expand our investigation to explore the broader implications of LLMs on educational outcomes and pedagogical contexts. Ultimately, our goal is to facilitate dynamic, inclusive, and effective learning experiences across various educational environments.

AB  - The modern educational landscape faces the challenge of maintaining effective, personalized mentorship amid expanding class sizes. This challenge is particularly pronounced in fields requiring hands-on practice, such as cybersecurity education. Teaching assistants and peer interactions provide some relief, but the student-to-educator ratio often remains high, limiting individualized attention. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising solution by potentially providing scalable and personalized guidance. In this paper, we introduce SENSAI, an AI-powered tutoring system that leverages LLMs to offer tailored feedback and assistance by transparently extracting and utilizing the learner’s working context, including their active terminals and edited files. Over the past year, SENSAI has been deployed in an applied cybersecurity curriculum at a large public R1 university and made available to a broader online community of global learners, assisting 2,742 users with hundreds of educational challenges. In total 178,074 messages were exchanged across 15,413 sessions, incurring a total cost of $1,979-comparable to that of a single undergraduate teaching assistant but with a significantly wider reach. SENSAI demonstrates significant improvements in student problem-solving efficiency and satisfaction, offering insights into the future role of AI in education.

AB  - Undergraduate students frequently encounter academic stress, highlighting the need for accessible and effective coping mechanisms. This study develops an AI chatbot grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles to meet the mental health needs of these students. The primary goal is to devise and assess a chatbot that delivers personalized support for managing academic stress. The chatbot engages students in meaningful conversations, identifies cognitive distortions in their thought processes, and provides customized coping strategies. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 turbo LLM for generating lifelike interactions and uses a vector database to store domain-specific knowledge. Responses are preprocessed with OpenAI embeddings for intent classification. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multinomial Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models are used for classifying cognitive distortions, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy of 85.94 \%. Intent classification is refined using cosine similarity, enhancing the chatbot's conversational accuracy. Although SVM outperforms other models, ongoing challenges call for further research to refine the chatbot's functionality and improve its impact on student well-being.

AB  - The automatic generation of hints by Large Language Models (LLMs) within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) has shown potential to enhance student learning. However, generating pedagogically sound hints that address student misconceptions and adhere to specific educational objectives remains challenging. This work explores using LLMs (GPT-4o and Llama-3-8B-instruct) as teachers to generate effective hints for students simulated through LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, or Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3) tackling math exercises designed for human high-school students, and designed using cognitive science principles. We present here the study of several dimensions: 1) identifying error patterns made by simulated students on secondary-level math exercises; 2) developing various prompts for GPT-4o as a teacher and evaluating their effectiveness in generating hints that enable simulated students to self-correct; and 3) testing the best-performing prompts, based on their ability to produce relevant hints and facilitate error correction, with Llama-3-8BInstruct as the teacher, allowing for a performance comparison with GPT-4o. The results show that model errors increase with higher temperature settings. Notably, when hints are generated by GPT-4o, the most effective prompts include prompts tailored to specific errors as well as prompts providing general hints based on common mathematical errors. Interestingly, Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a teacher showed better overall performance than GPT-4o. Also the problem-solving and response revision capabilities of the LLMs as students, particularly GPT-3.5-turbo, improved significantly after receiving hints, especially at lower temperature settings. However, models like Mistral-7B-Instruct demonstrated a decline in performance as the temperature increased. This study advances our understanding of the potential and limitations of LLMs in educational contexts, towards integrating these models into pedagogically grounded.

AB  - The demand for a multi-disciplinary workforce in long-term care is paramount, particularly in the realm of life care services. Art therapy has been recognized as being a promising approach for promoting learners’ empathy and competences for long-term care. However, in traditional art therapy courses, most students who are not interested in artworks or who do not have experience in artwork creation could lack confidence in their ability and motivation to engage in relevant activities, which could hence affect their learning performances. This study proposed a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI)-based art therapy approach to promote learners’ empathy and art therapy performance in gerontological nursing training. A quasi-experimental design was adopted. The participants were two classes of students from a nursing college. The experimental group with 33 students learned with the Generative AI-based art therapy approach focused on gerontological healthcare activities, whereas the control group with 32 students was taught using the traditional art therapy instruction. Compared to the control group, the experimental group nursing students showed significant improvement in their empathy and art performance. The findings could be a reference to those who intend to use images or graphics generated by generative AI in educational technology research.

AB  - This study explores international students' perceptions of GenAI technologies in higher education, focusing on how gender and age influence their willingness to adopt. A survey of 122 international graduate students from a private university in South Korea showed that the students are generally familiar with GenAI and its uses in learning. However, its usage varied in frequency. The study also finds that male students are more likely to use GenAI than female students. Additionally, the study revealed age-related differences in the willingness of international students to adopt GenAI, with younger students showing more interest and willingness than older students. However, despite the differences in interest levels in adopting GenAI among genders and ages, the study revealed that overall, there is a general willingness among international students to learn and apply GenAI technologies to their studies. The South Korean education system can be reformed to accommodate the emerging and growing relevance of GenAI in education by developing ethical capacities that will enhance learning while addressing students’ concerns.

AB  - Currently, there are several advanced large language models (LLMs) freely available for testing, and their use is steadily increasing. This paper aims to compare the results produced by some selected models for use in an educational setting. A qualitative research design was employed to identify the structure of the outputs and to analyse the information and key ideas related to questions about the purpose of education. The findings raise concerns about the reliability and relevance of the results, as they are neither equally informative nor consistent across different LLMs, with variations occurring even when the same questions are repeatedly tested. At present, there is no consensus on the optimal approach to integrating AI into education, nor on the potential impact of AI on learning, teaching, work and society. While it appears that the risks associated with AI can be managed, training in the use of LLMs is crucial at present, as these models will significantly impact various educational domains.

AB  - Background: The Liaison Committee on Medical Education requires that medical students receive individualized feedback on their self-directed learning skills. Pre-clinical students are asked to complete multiple spaced critical appraisal assignments. However, the individual feedback requires significant faculty time. As large language models (LLMs) can score and generate feedback, we explored their use in grading formative assessments through validity and feasibility lenses. Objective: To explore the consistency and feasibility of using an LLM to assess and provide feedback for formative assessments in undergraduate medical education. Design and Participants: This was a cross-sectional study of pre-clinical students’ critical appraisal assignments at University of Illinois College of Medicine (UICOM) during the 2022–2023 academic year. Intervention: An initial sample of ten assignments was used to develop a prompt. For each student entry, the de-identified assignment and prompt were provided to ChatGPT 3.5, and its scoring was compared to the existing faculty grade. Main Measures: Differences in scoring of individual items between ChatGPT and faculty were assessed. Scoring consistency using inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated as percent exact agreement. Chi-squared test was used to determine if there were significant differences in scores. Psychometric characteristics including internal-consistency reliability, area under precision-recall curve (AUCPR), and cost were studied. Key Results: In this cross-sectional study, 111 pre-clinical students’ faculty graded assignments were compared with that of ChatGPT and the scoring of individual items was comparable. The overall agreement between ChatGPT and faculty was 67% (OR = 2.53, P < 0.001); mean AUCPR was 0.69 (range 0.61–0.76). Internal-consistency reliability of ChatGPT was 0.64 and its use resulted in a fivefold reduction in faculty time, and potential savings of 150 faculty hours. Conclusions: This study of psychometric characteristics of ChatGPT demonstrates the potential role for LLMs to assist faculty in assessing and providing feedback for formative assignments.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have found several use cases in education, ranging from automatic question generation to essay evaluation. In this paper, we explore the potential of using LLMs to author Intelligent Tutoring Systems. A common pitfall of using LLMs as tutors is their straying from desired pedagogical strategies such as leaking the answer to the student, and in general, providing no guarantees on the validity or appropriateness of the tutor assistance. We argue that while LLMs with certain guardrails can take the place of subject experts, the overall pedagogical design still needs to be handcrafted for the best learning results. Based on this principle, we create a sample end-to-end tutoring system named MWPTutor, which uses LLMs to fill in the state space of a predefined finite state transducer. This approach retains the structure and the pedagogy of traditional tutoring systems that has been developed over the years by learning scientists but brings in additional flexibility of LLM-based approaches. Through a human evaluation study on two datasets with math word problems, we show that our hybrid approach achieves a better overall tutoring score than an instructed, but otherwise free-form, GPT-4. MWPTutor is completely modular and opens up the scope for the community to improve its performance by refining its individual modules or using different teaching strategies that it can follow.

AB  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are fundamental to modern web development, yet many learners encounter significant challenges with its intricate syntax and extensive styling capabilities. Approximately 85.7<sup>&#x0025;</sup> of students report difficulties in mastering CSS concepts, which are often compounded by motivational issues that hinder the learning process. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a web-based educational application designed to enhance CSS learning through the integration of an innovative pedagogical agent that employs advanced scaffolding methods. The application utilizes a dual-phase scaffolding approach, including procedural scaffolding, which offers structured guidance through pre-designed dialogues, and strategic scaffolding, which employs ChatGPT to deliver personalized, adaptive feedback tailored to individual learning needs. The implementation of these scaffolding techniques has led to significant improvements in both user engagement and learning outcomes. Thematic analysis revealed that 80&#x0025; of participants found the learning style provided by the pedagogical agent aligned with their personal preferences, compared to only 40&#x0025; with conventional methods. Additionally, 90&#x0025; of participants experienced increased motivation using the application with the pedagogical agent, versus 40&#x0025; with the conventional approach. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pedagogical agent in fostering a personalized and engaging learning experience, enhancing both motivation and learning. This research lays the chance for future advancements in interactive and adaptive learning systems, demonstrating the potential of combining pedagogical agents with sophisticated language models like ChatGPT to address educational and motivational challenges.

AB  - This paper presents SoloScholar, a novel asynchronous online learning platform designed to deliver personalized education to large undergraduate student groups by integrating established pedagogical frameworks with Large Language Models (LLMs). Leveraging Bloom's Revised Taxonomy, learners are categorized into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels to personalize the educational content. The platform employs the Questioning and Understanding to Improve Learning and Thinking (QUILT) model to structure tutorial sessions and simulate the teaching role of a tutor at a Higher Education Institute (HEI). To generate contextually relevant and cognitively appropriate questions, carefully crafted prompts are fed into LLMs, synthesizing information from reliable knowledge sources. The efficacy of SoloScholar was evaluated through a dual assessment approach: a technical evaluation using the Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment (RAGAS) framework and a human evaluation involving academic experts. The technical evaluation demonstrated high scores in answer relevancy and context utilization across all learning levels. Similarly, quantitative responses from academic experts indicated strong satisfaction with the quality and appropriateness of the generated content. The findings underscore the potential of integrating LLMs with pedagogical models to enhance personalization in online education. SoloScholar effectively addresses challenges associated with large-group teaching by providing adaptive learning experiences that cater to diverse cognitive needs.

AB  - The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies in higher education has raised concerns about academic integrity, assessment practices and student learning. Banning or blocking GenAI tools has proven ineffective, and punitive approaches ignore the potential benefits of these technologies. As a result, assessment reform has become a pressing topic in the GenAI era. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study conducted at British University Vietnam exploring the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Assessment Scale (AIAS), a flexible framework for incorporating GenAI into educational assessments. The AIAS consists of five levels, ranging from “no AI” to “full AI, ” enabling educators to design assessments that focus on areas requiring human input and critical thinking. The pilot study results indicate a significant reduction in academic misconduct cases related to GenAI and enhanced student engagement with GenAI technology. The AIAS facilitated a shift in pedagogical practices, with faculty members incorporating GenAI tools into their modules and students producing innovative multimodal submissions. The findings suggest that the AIAS can support the effective integration of GenAI in higher education, promoting academic integrity while leveraging technology’s potential to enhance learning experiences. Implications for practice or policy: • Higher education institutions should adopt flexible frameworks like the AIAS to guide ethical integration of GenAI into assessment practices. • Educators should design assessments that leverage GenAI capabilities, while supporting critical thinking and human input. • Institutional policies related to GenAI should be developed in consultation with stakeholders and regularly updated to keep pace with technological advancements. • Policymakers should prioritise research funding into the impacts of GenAI on higher education to inform evidence-based practices.

AB  - Educational AI systems often do not employ proper sophistication techniques to enhance learner interactions, organize their contextual knowledge or even deliver personalized feedback. To address this gap, this paper seeks to reform the way ChatGPT supports learners by employing fuzzy memory retention and thematic clustering. To achieve this, three modules have been developed: (a) the Fuzzy Memory Module which models human memory retention using time decay fuzzy weights to assign relevance to user interactions, (b) the Schema Manager which then organizes these prioritized interactions into thematic clusters for structured contextual representation, and (c) the Response Generator which uses the output of the other two modules to provide feedback to ChatGPT by synthesizing personalized responses. The synergy of these three modules is a novel approach to intelligent and AI tutoring that enhances the output of ChatGPT to learners for a more personalized learning experience. The system was evaluated by 120 undergraduate students in the course of Java programming, and the results are very promising, showing memory retrieval accuracy, schema relevance and personalized response quality. The results also show the system outperforms traditional methods in delivering adaptive and contextually enriched educational feedback.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fundamentally change the way people engage in computer programming. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become ubiquitous in natural and social sciences and education, yet no prior studies have explored the potential of LLMs to assist it. We designed NetLogo Chat to support the learning and practice of NetLogo, a programming language for ABM. To understand how users perceive, use, and need LLM-based interfaces, we interviewed 30 participants from global academia, industry, and graduate schools. Experts reported more perceived benefits than novices and were more inclined to adopt LLMs in their workflow. We found significant differences between experts and novices in their perceptions, behaviors, and needs for human-AI collaboration. We surfaced a knowledge gap between experts and novices as a possible reason for the benefit gap. We identified guidance, personalization, and integration as major needs for LLM-based interfaces to support the programming of ABM.

AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized numerous aspects of our lives and presents significant opportunities in education. However, specific digital competencies are essential to effectively leverage this technology’s potential. Notably, prompt engineering proficiency presents a significant barrier to achieving optimal outcomes. In response, various solutions are being developed, including custom GPTs available through OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform. This study validates ‘GamifIcA Edu’, a specialized GPT-based assistant for gamification and serious games, designed to enable educators to implement these pedagogical approaches without requiring advanced prompt engineering expertise. This is achieved through the utilization of pre-designed instructional frameworks. The assistant’s effectiveness was evaluated using a comprehensive rubric across five distinct use-case scenarios. Each scenario underwent four different tests, representing varied learning contexts across multiple academic disciplines.

AB  - The proposed piece seeks to critically explore pedagogical implication of ChatGPT, especially on students' capacities to author a text. The piece suggests that increased reliance on the ChatGPT, while provide short term solution to produce a text, in the long term it is likely to lead to 'death of an author'. Here the usage of the phrase is a twist to earlier usage by Barthes- which refers to 'death of an author' where once the text is written, it gets re-created in readers' reception and through interpretive act and imagination. The overarching argument of the paper emphasizes that technology is not neutral, especially in a context where its opacity has risen concerns about surveillance, control, and manipulation of human behavior, and therefore its infiltration in education begs critical questioning and sensitive e-value-ation. The discussion argues that rise of AI in education should be checked and not embraced uncritically, but rather it should be critically scrutinized, debated, and scaffolded through critical theoretical, pedagogical, and ethical references to counter its hegemonic and de-humanization of learning. For empirical part, the analysis draws upon reflections generated through a focus group discussion with four undergraduate students enrolled in a Bachelors degree in Computer Science who employed use of ChatGPT in preparing their speeches in context of a humanities course. The students found ChatGPT useful in terms of composing a text/speech and saving time and efforts. However, they realized that its use caused them loss of authentic learning, imagination and suppressed self's voice. Based on the analysis, the piece shares further insights into pedagogic implications, and suggest a pedagogical scaffolding using critical pedagogical references of relationship between technology and human/learners' values, distinction between information, knowledge, and wisdom, application and experiential learning references, and praxis in learning.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that imitate human tutors and aim to provide immediate and customized instructions or feedback to learners have shown their effectiveness in education. With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) further entitle the systems to complex and coherent conversational interactions. These systems would be of great help in language education as it involves developing skills in communication, which, however, drew relatively less attention. Additionally, due to the complicated cognitive development at younger ages, more endeavors are needed for practical uses. Scaffolding refers to a teaching technique where teachers provide support and guidance to students for learning and developing new concepts or skills. It is an effective way to support diverse learning needs, goals, processes, and outcomes. In this work, we investigate how pedagogical instructions facilitate the scaffolding in ITSs, by conducting a case study on guiding children to describe images for language learning. We construct different types of scaffolding tutoring systems grounded in four fundamental learning theories: knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, dialogic teaching, and zone of proximal development. For qualitative and quantitative analyses, we build and refine a seven-dimension rubric to evaluate the scaffolding process. In our experiment on GPT-4V, we observe that LLMs demonstrate strong potential to follow pedagogical instructions and achieve self-paced learning in different student groups. Moreover, we extend our evaluation framework from a manual to an automated approach, paving the way to benchmark various conversational tutoring systems.

AB  - Educational dialogue classification is a critical task for analyzing classroom interactions and fostering effective teaching strategies. However, the scarcity of annotated data and the high cost of manual labeling pose significant challenges, especially in low-resource educational contexts. This article presents the EduDCM framework for the first time, offering an original approach to addressing these challenges. EduDCM innovatively integrates distant supervision with the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the construction of high-quality educational dialogue classification datasets. EduDCM reduces the noise typically associated with distant supervision by leveraging LLMs for context-aware label generation and incorporating heuristic alignment techniques. To validate the framework, we constructed the EduTalk dataset, encompassing diverse classroom dialogues labeled with pedagogical categories. Extensive experiments on EduTalk and publicly available datasets, combined with expert evaluations, confirm the superior quality of EduDCM-generated datasets. Models trained on EduDCM data achieved a performance comparable to that of manually annotated datasets. Expert evaluations using a 5-point Likert scale show that EduDCM outperforms Template-Based Generation and Few-Shot GPT in terms of annotation accuracy, category coverage, and consistency. These findings emphasize EduDCM’s novelty and its effectiveness in generating high-quality, scalable datasets for low-resource educational NLP tasks, thus reducing manual annotation efforts.

AB  - The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT in education has raised concerns that students may become dependent on AI-generated solutions, potentially stifling the development of critical thinking skills. Compounding this issue is the fact that Bloom’s Taxonomy—the widely used framework for designing educational goals—fails to address the cognitive demands of AI-assisted learning. This exploratory study presents a revised framework that incorporates AI-specific competencies, offering a more relevant model for nurturing critical thinking in an AI-driven environment. Using a conceptual approach supported by empirical evidence from MSc Marketing students’ interactions with AI tools over 4 weeks, the study found that AI can both enhance and challenge critical thinking across cognitive, affective, and metacognitive domains. Key elements such as melioration, ethical reasoning, collaboration, and reflective thinking were identified as critical for developing deeper engagement with AI-generated content. The framework proposes 12 propositions that inform future research and pedagogical strategies. This study outlines a research agenda for examining AI’s impact on cognitive development, serving as a resource for educators, policymakers, and researchers seeking to adapt teaching methods for AI-assisted education.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of utilizing large language models (LLMs) to enhance self-regulated learning (SRL) strategy instruction in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing. An LLM-supported Cognitive Academic Language Learning Model (CALLA-LLM) was developed and examined for its potential to improve elementary students’ EFL writing performance, SRL strategy use, and writing motivation. In a randomized controlled trial, 65 elementary school students were divided into an experimental group receiving CALLA-LLM instruction and a control group receiving traditional CALLA instruction. Both groups learned SRL strategies over 5 weeks, with data collected pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at a one-month follow-up. Results showed that the CALLA-LLM group made significant improvements in writing performance, SRL strategy use, and writing motivation, maintained most of the gains at follow-up, and significantly outperformed the control group. Findings provide empirical evidence for the efficacy of the CALLA-LLM model in enhancing EFL writing strategy instruction, lending support for integrating AI technologies such as LLMs into English language teaching. Moreover, the study underscores the importance of the “Humans in the Loop” approach, which emphasizes the essential role of human educators in AI-assisted language instruction.

AB  - Purpose: In 2022 generative AI took the Internet world by storm. Free access to tools that can generate text and images that pass for human creations triggered fiery debates about the potential uses and misuses of generative AI in education. There has risen a need to check the popular utopian and dystopian narratives about AI against the diversity of hopes, concerns and future imaginaries that educators themselves associate with generative AI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perspectives of Finnish teacher educators on the use of AI in education. Design/methodology/approach: This article reports findings from a hands-on workshop in teacher training, where participants learned about how generative AI works, collaboratively explored generative AI and then reflected on its potential and challenges. Findings: The results reveal nuanced, calm and thoughtful imaginaries rooted in deep understanding of educational policy, evaluation and the sociocultural context of education. The results cover teachers’ views on the impact of AI on learners’ agency, metacognition, self-regulation and more. Originality/value: This article offers a unique exploration into the perceptions and imaginaries of educators regarding generative AI in specific (instead of “monolithic AI”), moving beyond dystopian views and instead focusing on the potential of AI to align with existing pedagogical practices. The educators contrasted the common techno-deterministic narratives and perceived AI as an avenue to support formative assessment practices and development of metacognition, self-regulation, responsibility and well-being. The novel insights also include the need for AI education that critically incorporates social and ethical viewpoints and fosters visions for a future with culturally, socially and environmentally sustainable AI.

AB  - Contribution: This research explores the benefits and challenges of developing, deploying, and evaluating a large language model (LLM) chatbot, MoodleBot, in computer science classroom settings. It highlights the potential of integrating LLMs into LMSs like Moodle to support self-regulated learning (SRL) and help-seeking behavior. Background: Computer science educators face immense challenges incorporating novel tools into LMSs to create a supportive and engaging learning environment. MoodleBot addresses this challenge by offering an interactive platform for both students and teachers. Research Questions: Despite issues like bias, hallucinations, and teachers' and educators' resistance to embracing new (AI) technologies, this research investigates two questions: (RQ1) To what extent do students accept MoodleBot as a valuable tool for learning support? (RQ2) How accurately does MoodleBot churn out responses, and how congruent are these with the established course content? Methodology: This study reviews pedagogical literature on AI-driven chatbots and adopts the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for MoodleBot's design and data processing. The technology acceptance model (TAM) evaluates user acceptance through constructs like perceived usefulness (PU) and Ease of Use. Forty-six students participated, with 30 completing the TAM questionnaire. Findings: LLM-based chatbots like MoodleBot can significantly improve the teaching and learning process. This study revealed a high accuracy rate (88%) in providing course-related assistance. Positive responses from students attest to the efficacy and applicability of AI-driven educational tools. These findings indicate that educational chatbots are suitable for integration into courses to improve personalized learning and reduce teacher administrative burden, although improvements in automated fact-checking are needed.

AB  - This study addresses the gap in understanding the impact of ChatGPT, on Java programming language education. We examined ChatGPT's afinity on undergraduate Information Systems students learning Java through a mixed-methods approach. Quantitatively, we assessed constructs like ChatGPT Prompting Skills, Trust, Objective Values, and their relationship with student satisfaction, revealing mixed effectiveness. Qualitatively, we explored students’ perspectives, uncovering insights into ChatGPT's role in coding support and the nuances of its educational impact. Our findings indicate that while ChatGPT can enhance certain aspects of learning, its effectiveness varies with context and task complexity. Key positive findings from the regression analysis indicated that ChatGPT's prompting skills positively impacted both Objective and Subjective Values, suggesting a significant role in enhancing students’ understanding and engagement with programming concepts. This positive influence extends to the relationship between Subjective Value and Student Satisfaction, highlighting the importance of students’ subjective experiences in their overall satisfaction with learning programming languages. The study contributes to the evolving discourse on AI in education, highlighting the need to integrate LLMs carefully in educational settings. It underscores the importance of aligning AI tools with specific learning objectives and outlines implications for educators and AI developers in optimizing these tools for educational purposes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way programming is taught and learnt and is redefining t he way programming skills are assessed in the continuously changing field of computer science education. This paper introduces a novel approach for teaching and evaluating programming knowledge by reversing Bloom's taxonomy in order to accommodate AI-powered learning. Traditionally, Bloom's taxonomy progresses from basic cognitive skills like remembering and understanding to advanced skills like creating. With AI tools such as WebSim.ai and Anthropic Artifacts now capable of generating sophisticated outputs, the focus shifts away from students' ability to create, as these tools handle that task effectively. Instead, this paper proposes placing a higher emphasis on students' ability to understand and critically analyze AI -generated solutions, assessing their comprehension and ability to reverse-engineer existing work. We call this the Reverse Bloom Taxonomy, where students begin with creation and then move toward deeper understanding of the subject matter. This paper outlines the methodology for applying this reversed framework in programming education and presents a promising concept for improving student learning outcomes. The discussion addresses challenges in implementation and emphasizes the strategic integration of AI -driven learning to prepare students for a technology-driven workforce.

AB  - ChatGPT, a language-learning model chatbot, has garnered considerable attention for its ability to respond to users’ questions. Using data from 14 countries and 186 institutions, we compare ChatGPT and student performance for 28,085 questions from accounting assessments and textbook test banks. As of January 2023, ChatGPT provides correct answers for 56.5 percent of questions and partially correct answers for an additional 9.4 percent of questions. When considering point values for questions, students significantly outperform ChatGPT with a 76.7 percent average on assessments compared to 47.5 percent for ChatGPT if no partial credit is awarded and 56.5percent if partial credit is awarded. Still, ChatGPT performs better than the student average for 15.8 percent of assessments when we include partial credit. We provide evidence of how ChatGPT performs on different question types, accounting topics, class levels, open/closed assessments, and test bank questions. We also discuss implications for accounting education and research.

AB  - The pretrained large language models have been widely tested for their performance on some challenging tasks including arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. Recently how to combine LLMs with prompting techniques has attracted lots of researchers to propose their models to automatically solve math word problems. However, most research works focus on solving math problems at the elementary school level and few works aim to solve problems in science disciplines, e.g., Physics. In this exploratory study, we discussed the potential pedagogical benefits of using ChatGPT in physics and demonstrated how to prompt ChatGPT in solving physics problems. The results suggest that ChatGPT is able to solve some physics calculation problems, explain solutions, and generate new exercises at a human level.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost-efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS, however, are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagogical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions. Through post-hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions, we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts), which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two-step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response, we implemented two CITS models using GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.

AB  - The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has led to the creation of ChatGPT. Despite its potential benefits, the effects of ChatGPT on higher education accessibility and inclusion are not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of ChatGPT on the accessibility and inclusivity in higher education for students. We delivered five questions to identify the applicability of ChatGPT, including the utilization of ChatGPT in higher education, the benefits of ChatGPT in higher education, the perception of quality answered by ChatGPT, user-friendliness interface of ChatGPT, and ChatGPT on enhanced higher education accessibility and inclusivity. These focus questions were purposefully created to strategise the integration of ChatGPT within the higher education framework. Total of 85 respondents, comprising undergradu-ate students from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Nigeria participated in this study. It was found that a significant 75.6% of respondents feel ChatGPT has enhanced higher education accessibility and inclusivity. This highlights the potential of AI technologies to improve educational environment by increasing accessibility and levelling the learning ecosystem for students with various requirements and back-grounds. There was still a widespread distinction of knowledge and viewpoints among students. Although some students consider ChatGPT to be just marginally useful and are only slightly satisfied with its quality, others express high satisfaction. It is important to note that some students did not find ChatGPT to be useful and have reservations about its accuracy. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of ChatGPT can play in decreasing barriers to education and fostering more classroom diversity. The findings of this study can also inform the development of best practises for incorporating technology such as ChatGPT into higher education institutions. This would eventually optimise ChatGPT potential impact on accessibility and inclusivity. All in all, this study can play a crucial role in changing the future of higher education using ChatGPT and ensuring that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed.

AB  - This study delves into integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT-powered robots, as educational tools in primary school mathematics. Against the backdrop of Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating educational settings, our investigation focuses on the response of young learners to errors made by these LLM-powered robots. Employing a user study approach, we conducted an experiment using the Pepper robot in a primary school classroom environment, where 77 primary school students from multiple grades (Year 3 to 5) took part in interacting with the robot. Our statistically significant findings highlight that most students, regardless of the year group, could discern between correct and incorrect responses generated by the robots, demonstrating a promising level of understanding and engagement with the AI-driven educational tool. Additionally, we observed that students' correctness in answering the Maths questions significantly influenced their ability to identify errors, underscoring the importance of prior knowledge in verifying LLM responses and detecting errors. Additionally, we examined potential confounding factors such as age and gender. Our findings underscore the importance of gradually integrating AI-powered educational tools under the guidance of domain experts following thorough verification processes.

AB  - Introduction: Based on comprehensive network-pharmacology and molecular docking analysis, this study was intended to unveil the multiple mechanisms of Yi-Gai-San (YGS) in treating the tremor-dominant subtype of Parkinson's disease (PD-DT). The compounds of YGS were meticulously analyzed, selected, and standardized with references to their pharmacological attributes. Its components included Gouteng (Uncaria rhynchophylla), Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri), Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma), Danggui (Angelicae sinensis radix), Fuling (Wolfiporia extensa), Baizhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma), and Gancao (Licorice, Glycyrrhizae radix). Methods: We identified 75 active compounds within YGS. From these, we predicted 110 gene targets, which exhibited a direct association with PD-DT. PPI network results highlighted core target proteins, including TP53, SLC6A3, GAPDH, MAOB, AKT, BAX, IL6, BCL2, PKA, and CASP3. These proteins potentially alleviate PD-DT by targeting inflammation, modulating neuronal cell apoptosis, and regulating the dopamine system. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses emphasized that YGS might influence various mechanisms, such as the apoptotic process, mitochondrial autophagy, Age-Rage signaling, and dopaminergic and serotonergic synapses. The core proteins from the PPI analysis were selected for the docking experiment. Results: The docking results demonstrated that the most stable ligand-receptor conformations were kaempferol with CASP3 (-9.5 kcal/mol), stigmasterol with SLC6A3 (-10.5 kcal/mol), shinpterocarpin with BCL2L1 (-9.6 kcal/mol), hirsutine with MAOB (-9.7 kcal/mol), hederagenin with PRKACA (-9.8 kcal/mol), and yatein with GAPDH (-9.8 kcal/mol). These results provide us with research objectives for future endeavors in extracting single compounds for drug manufacturing or in-depth studies on drug mechanisms. Conclusion: From these computational findings, we suggested that YGS might mitigate PD-DT via “multi-compounds, multi-targets, and multi-pathways.”.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are poised to become an increasingly important part of education in the anatomical sciences. OpenAI has also introduced generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), which are customizable versions of the standard ChatGPT application. There is little research that has explored the potential of GPTs to serve as intelligent tutoring systems for learning the anatomical sciences. The objective of this study was to describe the design and explore the performance of AnatomyGPT, a customized artificial intelligence application intended for anatomical sciences education. The AnatomyGPT application was configured with GPT Builder by uploading open-source textbooks as knowledge sources and by providing pedagogical instructions for how to interact with users. The performance of AnatomyGPT was compared with ChatGPT by evaluating the responses of both applications to prompts of the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) sample items with respect to accuracy, rationales, and citations. AnatomyGPT achieved high scores on the NBME sample items for Gross Anatomy, Embryology, Histology, and Neuroscience and scored comparably to ChatGPT. In addition, AnatomyGPT provided several citations in the responses that it generated, while ChatGPT provided none. Both GPTs provided rationales for all sample items. The customized AnatomyGPT application demonstrated preliminary potential as an intelligent tutoring system by generating responses with increased citations as compared with the standard ChatGPT application. The findings of this study suggest that instructors and students may wish to create their own custom GPTs for teaching and learning anatomy. Future research is needed to further develop and characterize the potential of GPTs for anatomy education.

AB  - While automatic dialogue tutors hold great potential in making education personalized and more accessible, research on such systems has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently large and high-quality datasets. Collecting such datasets remains challenging, as recording tutoring sessions raises privacy concerns and crowdsourcing leads to insufficient data quality. To address this, we propose a framework to generate such dialogues by pairing human teachers with a Large Language Model (LLM) prompted to represent common student errors. We describe how we use this framework to collect MathDial, a dataset of 3k one-to-one teacher-student tutoring dialogues grounded in multi-step math reasoning problems. While models like GPT-3 are good problem solvers, they fail at tutoring because they generate factually incorrect feedback or are prone to revealing solutions to students too early. To overcome this, we let teachers provide learning opportunities to students by guiding them using various scaffolding questions according to a taxonomy of teacher moves. We demonstrate MathDial and its extensive annotations can be used to finetune models to be more effective tutors (and not just solvers). We confirm this by automatic and human evaluation, notably in an interactive setting that measures the trade-off between student solving success and telling solutions. The dataset is released publicly.

AB  - The introduction of ChatGPT for public use has generated increasing interest among educational researchers in evaluating the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in pedagogical settings. This study aims to contribute to this growing body of research by developing an entire course curriculum and lesson plans exclusively using ChatGPT. Case study findings support many of the affordances and limitations observed in previous studies, such as identifying appropriate topics and subtopics for lessons, as well as identifying the occurrence of hallucinations that fabricate data. This study also revealed new limitations in the design capabilities of ChatGPT. Specifically, lessons are designed as standalone units of information. Unlike human educators, AI lacks the ability to integrate prior lessons with current learning experiences or strategically prepare students for future learning outcomes. Understanding these affordances and limitations allows ChatGPT to be a useful tool for educators engaging in instructional design.

AB  - ChatGPT's advanced text generation capability has significant potential for the development of innovative and effective pedagogical strategies in mathematics teaching. The integration of ChatGPT into the mathematical story-focused 5E lesson plan preparation process is a concrete reflection of this potential. The success of this integration depends primarily on how mathematics teachers and pre-service teachers interact with and perceive ChatGPT. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the interactions of three mathematics teachers and three pre-service teachers with ChatGPT during the process of preparing mathematical story-focused 5E lesson plans. The research aims to evaluate the qualities of the prompts created by the participants in this process, the benefits provided by ChatGPT, and the participants' metaphorical perceptions of ChatGPT. Open-ended questionnaires and focus group interviews were conducted, and participants' prompt archives were also analyzed. The data analysis incorporated a meticulously conducted inter-rater reliability assessment between a human expert and ChatGPT. The results revealed that the participants used ChatGPT differently, with particularly large variations in the number of prompts. Some participants created a large number of prompts, while others worked with much fewer prompts, but it was observed that creating a large number of prompts did not always translate into benefits. Factors like originality, time management, self-efficacy, and ChatGPT's mathematical performance were identified as limiting factors. Perceptions of ChatGPT varied, with some participants viewing it as an assistant and others associating it with cheating. Based on these findings, recommendations for effectively using ChatGPT are provided.

AB  - With the recent advancement in technology, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can produce hyper-realistic multimedia content, such as audio, text, images, and videos. Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners' retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its humanlike qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education.

AB  - This work in progress (WIP) innovative practice paper describes the incorporation of ChatGPT into technical writing at the undergraduate and graduate level of an engineering program. Since professional skills play a critical role in the success of an engineer, specifically communication through writing, it is critical to incorporate writing into the curriculum; however, large class sizes, overloaded faculty, and the qualitative aspect of writing, can make it difficult to convince faculty to do so. The rise of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Conversational Agents (AI-DCA) that can understand and respond to human language and give immediate feedback could aid in resolving this challenge. To understand the students&#x0027; perceptions of using AI platforms for revisions, a homework assignment in both a graduate and undergraduate course incorporated the use of ChatGPT for editing and creation. Then, a survey that included their likes and concerns about using AI for educational purposes was given. The preliminary results found that many students had never used ChatGPT, and that they were impressed with its ability to correct grammar mistakes and assist in making sentences more concise. While the majority of both graduate and undergraduate students found value in the changes that ChatGPT suggested, concerns regarding ethics, accuracy, and the use of AI in general were mentioned. Although the setting for this innovative practice was within the context of chemical engineering education, the principles can be applied to other disciplines as well. Motivations for adopting this practice include the desire to improve student writing skills, increase engagement and accessibility, and better prepare students for future careers in industry.

AB  - Conversational AI (C-AI), like OpenAI's ChatGPT [38] or Google's Gemini [1], has seen a surge in development in recent years, driven by advancements in large language models. C-AI has the unique capability to instantaneously communicate with others using vast and contextual knowledge, providing personalized assistance tailored to individual needs. While the specific applications and advantages of conversational technologies are still being explored, prior research has noted the potential for conversational agents to serve in pedagogical settings, such as teaching agents, collaborative partners, or motivational tools [13,30]. The successful development and implementation of pedagogical C-AI relies on an understanding of learners' perceptions, trust, and overall acceptance of C-AI. There is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing learners' trust and acceptance of this emerging technology. Grounded in the theories proposed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [16], the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [47], and Mayer, Davis and Schoorman's model of organizational trust [35], this paper proposes a model of learners' acceptance and trust for C-AI. The proposed model integrates factors relating to learners' perceptions and trust of C-AI, and additionally, four groups of moderating variables (e.g. individual characteristics). The proposed model hypothesizes that learners' perceptions and trust significantly influence their acceptance and behavioral intention to use C-AI. The relationships between learners' perceptions, trust, and acceptance are additionally proposed to be influenced by four groups of moderating variables: individual characteristics, AI characteristics, facilitating conditions, and subjective norms. To validate the proposed model, we plan to collect survey data and leverage structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. We will specifically evaluate the fitness of the proposed model through chi-square tests, RMSEA, CFI, and SRMR metrics. This study can provide valuable insights toward the scalable adoption and usage of C-AI in learning environments. Understanding the structural relationships between the factors that influence learners' acceptance and trust of pedagogical C-AI will be crucial for designing and deploying these technologies in ways that foster learners' engagement, self-efficacy, academic interest, and ultimately lead to positive learning outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT can impact an individual's cognitive processes, such as thinking, learning, and problem-solving. Recent studies have explored ChatGPT in education, but they mainly rely on educator and learner surveys for feedback and report qualitative data findings. There is also a lack of controlled experiments measuring the effect of integrating ChatGPT into Adaptive E-learning Systems (AESs) on learning. This paper aims to fill this research gap by evaluating AESs incorporating ChatGPT on learning outcomes and learner satisfaction. A framework for ChatGPT-enhanced AESs was proposed. An AES was developed based on this framework and served as the primary learning platform in a controlled experiment to teach Java programming. The experiment involved 54 male first-year undergraduate students majoring in Business Administration and primarily focused on evaluating learning outcomes and learner satisfaction. The results indicated that the AES with ChatGPT led to better outcomes and higher learning satisfaction than the AES without ChatGPT. This paper discusses these findings and suggests future research directions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022, has generated both excitement and concern within the healthcare education, research, and practice communities. This study aimed to explore the knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and practices of undergraduate medical students regarding the use of ChatGPT and similar chatbots in their academic work. METHODS: An anonymous, structured questionnaire was developed using Google Forms and administered to medical students as part of a cross-sectional study. The survey targeted undergraduate medical students from four governorates in Egypt. The questionnaire link was distributed through social media platforms, including Facebook and WhatsApp. The survey comprised four sections: socio-demographic characteristics, perceptions, attitudes, and practices. RESULTS: The survey achieved a response rate of 96%, with 614 out of 640 approached students participating. Prior to the study, most respondents (78.5%) had personal experience using it. Overall, respondents demonstrated positive perceptions, attitudes, and practices toward ChatGPT, with mean scores exceeding 3 for all three variables: 3.99 ± 0.60 for perceptions, 3.01 ± 0.46 for attitudes, and 3.55 ± 0.55 for practices. In general, the students exhibited a high degree of trust in the model, with approximately half trusting the accuracy and reliability of the information provided by ChatGPT. However, more than two-thirds expressed apprehension about its potential misuse in medical education, and around 60% were concerned about the accuracy of information ChatGPT might generate on complex medical topics. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students show strong interest and trust in using ChatGPT and similar chatbots for academic purposes but have concerns about the reliability of the information and potential misuse in medical education. The use of AI tools should follow ethical guidelines set by academic institutions, with regular updates to keep pace with technological progress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the safety and accuracy of ChatGPT recommendations in comparison to the evidence-based guidelines from the North American Spine Society (NASS) for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy. METHODS ChatGPT was prompted with questions from the 2011 NASS clinical guidelines for cervical radiculopathy and evaluated for concordance. Selected key phrases within the NASS guidelines were identified. Completeness was measured as the number of overlapping key phrases between ChatGPT responses and NASS guidelines divided by the total number of key phrases. A senior spine surgeon evaluated the ChatGPT responses for safety and accuracy. ChatGPT responses were further evaluated on their readability, similarity, and consistency. Flesch Reading Ease scores and Flesch-Kincaid reading levels were measured to assess readability. The Jaccard Similarity Index was used to assess agreement between ChatGPT responses and NASS clinical guidelines. RESULTS A total of 100 key phrases were identified across 14 NASS clinical guidelines. The mean completeness of ChatGPT-4 was 46%. ChatGPT-3.5 yielded a completeness of 34%. ChatGPT-4 outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 by a margin of 12%. ChatGPT-4.0 outputs had a mean Flesch reading score of 15.24, which is very difficult to read, requiring a college graduate education to understand. ChatGPT-3.5 outputs had a lower mean Flesch reading score of 8.73, indicating that they are even more difficult to read and require a professional education level to do so. However, both versions of ChatGPT were more accessible than NASS guidelines, which had a mean Flesch reading score of 4.58. Furthermore, with NASS guidelines as a reference, ChatGPT-3.5 registered a mean ± SD Jaccard Similarity Index score of 0.20 ± 0.078 while ChatGPT-4 had a mean of 0.18 ± 0.068. Based on physician evaluation, outputs from ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.0 were safe 100% of the time. Thirteen of 14 (92.8%) ChatGPT-3.5 responses and 14 of 14 (100%) ChatGPT-4.0 responses were in agreement with current best clinical practices for cervical radiculopathy according to a senior spine surgeon. CONCLUSIONS ChatGPT models were able to provide safe and accurate but incomplete responses to NASS clinical guideline questions about cervical radiculopathy. Although the authors’ results suggest that improvements are required before ChatGPT can be reliably deployed in a clinical setting, future versions of the LLM hold promise as an updated reference for guidelines on cervical radiculopathy. Future versions must prioritize accessibility and comprehensibility for a diverse audience.

AB  - Automated written corrective feedback (AWCF) has been widely applied in second language (L2) writing classrooms in the past few decades. Recently, the introduction of tools based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) such as ChatGPT heralds groundbreaking changes in the conceptualization and practice of AWCF in L2 pedagogy. However, students’ engagement in such an interactive and intelligent learning environment remains unstudied. The present study aims to investigate L2 writers’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement with ChatGPT as an AWCF provider for writing products. This mixed-method multiple case study explored four L2 writers’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement with AWCF provided by ChatGPT. Bearing the conversational and generative mechanisms of ChatGPT in mind, data on students’ engagement were collected from various sources: prompt writing techniques, revision operations, utilization of metacognitive and cognitive strategies, and attitudinal responses to the feedback. The results indicated that: 1) behavioral engagement was related to their individual differences in language proficiencies and technological competencies; 2) the participants have failed to metacognitively regulate the learning processes in an effective manner; and 3) ChatGPT ushered in an affectively engaging, albeit competence-demanding and time-consuming, learning environment for L2 writers. The study delivers conceptual and pedagogical implications for educators and researchers poised to incorporate GAI-based technologies in language education.

AB  - The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has permanently changed life as we know it. And education has been no exception. Understanding the issues and benefits that may come with the implementation of AI into higher education, in particular, this study examines the impact of advanced AI models, like ChatGPT, on academic integrity. By employing a mixed-methods approach, the study gathers insights from undergraduate students at the University "St. Kliment Ohridski" in Bitola, North Macedonia, exploring their views on AI's role in academic practices. By identifying the key points through a brief literature review, this study finds that the concerns about the use of AI in education are indeed founded – concerns including potential for cheating and the ethical dilemmas posed by such technologies. Some of these concerns were also confirmed by the data obtained through our survey. A sample of 114 undergraduate students kindly provided their responses for this study, helping further our insights with their perspective. The findings from the survey revealed that students are moderately comfortable with using AI for academic purposes, with a notable portion of them admitting to using ChatGPT without disclosure to professors. The reasons behind the undisclosed use of AI, according to the data collected, include pressures for high grades, time constraints and the accepted belief that cheating is “what everyone is doing”. Despite its limitations, such as reliance on self-reported data and its focus on a specific geographic and academic context, we believe that the study still manages to make a small, yet significant contribution to the ethical challenges posed by AI in education.

AB  - General-purpose Language Models (LMs) bypass the need for task-specific model training by allowing textual prompts to specify a downstream task (e.g., assessment, feedback generation). One of the main benefits of using a prompt-based learning method is that it circumvents the need for supervised data and training on the downstream task. However, in high-stakes settings like education, LMs need to be evaluated rigorously on the specific downstream tasks before putting them in front of the students. Unlike traditional supervised learning models that are evaluated for a specific task, LMs are often evaluated on benchmark data and tasks that may not reflect the downstream use in education. Hence, we first present arguments for contextual evaluation of LMs. Next, we present a framework for behavior analysis - an alternative approach for model evaluation. Behavior analysis involves defining LM behaviors and designing tests (e.g., invariance to irrelevant perturbations). Using a case study of assessing science ideas in student essays, with past data from ecologically valid contexts, we illustrate how behavior analysis allowed for the identification of LM failures that are likely to go unnoticed in tests for generalization. By making the LMs more transparent for scrutiny, this study suggests a way to improve LM reliability and trustworthiness. Future studies will work with education stakeholders in translating their implicit expectations of desired model behaviors into explicitly defined tests, thereby building their agency and trust in educational AI.

Among various AI tools, ChatGPT stands out for its user-friendly nature and wide accessibility to the public. However, despite their countless potential benefits, these tools also face significant challenges, especially in sensitive areas like Education. In this publication, we conduct a prompt engineering essay with ChatGPT to understand the potential and challenges of this tool in designing new, high-quality chemistry laboratory activities. We aimed to assess its performance in proposing scientifically and pedagogically suitable protocols for chemistry laboratory activities based on the 11th-grade Portuguese curriculum. The initial exploratory essay was conducted to fine-tune the prompt, followed by the analysis of proposals for the five mandatory laboratory activities in this subject. ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to interpret and reproduce the specialized symbolic language of chemistry, effectively conceptualizing problems and laboratory activities in a clear and understandable manner for a broader audience (i.e., chemistry students). However, it is crucial to highlight the scientific-pedagogical limitations concerning the accuracy and appropriateness of the proposed laboratory activities, particularly in terms of safety and sustainability. Therefore, the use of AI in education should be approached critically and reflectively. While AI holds immense potential to transform the dynamics of teaching and learning, the role and expertise of the Chemistry teacher remain of the utmost importance to ensure the scientific and pedagogical quality of Chemistry classes.

AB  - Understanding student behavior in educational settings is critical in improving both the quality of pedagogy and the level of student engagement. While various AI-based models exist for classroom analysis, they tend to specialize in limited tasks and lack generalizability across diverse educational environments. Additionally, these models often fall short in ensuring student privacy and in providing actionable insights accessible to educators. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified, end-to-end framework by leveraging temporal action detection techniques and advanced large language models for a more nuanced student behavior analysis. Our proposed framework provides an end-to-end pipeline that starts with raw classroom video footage and culminates in the autonomous generation of pedagogical reports. It offers a comprehensive and scalable solution for student behavior analysis. Experimental validation confirms the capability of our framework to accurately identify student behaviors and to produce pedagogically meaningful insights, thereby setting the stage for future AI-assisted educational assessments.

AB  - Some countries struggle to respond in a personalized way to a growing student base, owing to the student-teacher ratio being 13:1 on average. Practice and theoretical review indicate that there is an analysis lack in e-learning of the Pedagogical Conversational Agent (PCA) for tutoring in the development of educational research projects. Therefore, the objective was to determine the algorithm of the PCA dialogic system for tutoring the Integrating Knowledge Project at the National University of Education. The population was students of the Basic Education Career, distance learning, academic period semester I—2021 (N = 1,124), and the sample, with a 95% confidence level and an estimated sampling error of 5%, was 287 participants. They were selected by cluster sampling technique. Paradigm was pragmatism, and method was a light mixed method of convergent design (questionnaire variant) of descriptive scope, cross-sectional and empirical. The research used descriptive statistics and content analysis. The main results were the algorithm’s meta-inferences, which should have a teacher/tutor’s role, offer emotional support, identify errors in the dialogue topics of the domain, and so forth. This research is significant because it determines the generalities and particularity of the PCA dialogue system from and for the students. Moreover, it initiates the linkage of the PCA dialogue system and the tutoring of educational research projects.

AB  - Objectives. The study aims to describe inadequate, disrespectful, and abusive palliative and hospice care received by lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) patients and their spouses/partners due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Methods. A national sample of 865 healthcare professionals recruited from palliative and hospice care professional organizations completed an online survey. Respondents were asked to describe their observations of inadequate, disrespectful, or abusive care to LGB patients and their spouses/partners. Results. There were 15.6% who reported observing disrespectful care to LGB patients, 7.3% observed inadequate care, and 1.6% observed abusive care; 43% reported discriminatory care toward the spouses/partners. Disrespectful care to LGB patients included insensitive and judgmental attitudes and behaviors, gossip and ridicule, and disrespect of the spouse/partner. Inadequate care included denial of care; care that was delayed incomplete, or rushed; dismissive or antagonistic treatment; privacy and confidentiality violations; and dismissive treatment of the spouse/partner. Significance of results. These findings provide evidence of discrimination faced by LGB patients and partners while receiving care for serious illness. Hospice and palliative care programs should promote respectful, inclusive, and affirming care for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community, including policies and practices that are welcoming and supportive to both employees and patients. Staff at all levels should be trained to create safe and respectful environments for LGBTQ patients and their families.

AB  - In recent decades, flipped learning has been adopted by teachers to improve learning achievement. However, it is challenging to provide all students with instant personalised guidance at the same time. To address this gap, based on Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and the learning scaffolding theory, I developed a ChatGPT-based flipped learning guiding approach (ChatGPT-FLGA) according to the analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation model. To investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT-FLGA, a quasi-experiment was conducted in the learning activities of a courseware project. One of two classes was randomly assigned to the experimental group, while the other was assigned to the control group. The students in both classes received flipped classroom instruction and conducted discussions through Tencent QQ applications, but only those in the experimental group learned with ChatGPT-FLGA. The results revealed that the ChatGPT-FLGA significantly improved students’ performance, self-efficacy, learning attitudes, intrinsic motivation and creative thinking. The research findings enrich the literature on ChatGPT in flipped classrooms by addressing the influence of ChatGPT-FLGA on students' performance and perceptions. Implications for practice or policy: • Teachers and universities should utilise ChatGPT as a tool for supporting students’ learning and promoting their problem-solving skills. • Course designers and academic staff can leverage ChatGPT-FLGA to enact student-centred pedagogical transformation in massive open online courses or flipped learning. • Course designers should master how to use ChatGPT-FLGA and its learning system, to foster learners’ self-regulated learning, help them promote online self-efficacy and overcome difficulties in learning motivation and creative thinking ability.

AB  - The irruption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based chatbot tools is undoubtedly at the frontiers of education. AI chatbots in education has emerged as a promising solution to enhance the quality of education and to improve learning outcomes. As all new technology does, it has begun to generate news about prohibition, ethical aspects, anti-plagiarism detection tools, and a series of policies from different educational systems. However, we should not deny the positive aspects of these tools if they are well used. AI-based chatbots have interesting potential to help both teachers and students, who must learn to use them well for their own benefit. This article provides an overview of AI-based chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI. GPT, or 'Generative Pre-Training Transformer' is a neural network trained to generate 'human-like text' by predicting the next word in a sequence given a large dataset of examples. ChatGPT uses the neural network model and is used to generate responses to students' questions in real time, in the sense of a personal teacher assistant. Chatbots are designed to be able to carryon a natural conversation by understanding the context of the conversation, generating appropriate responses, and engaging in active interaction. Nowadays, this type of tool can generate more than just text; for example, the use of LaTeX code (using TeXGPT) or tools for coding and debugging programming exercises. This work explores the potential role that AI-based chatbots can have in engineering education, by examining the answers of a group of teachers' about how the use of AI-based chatbots can improve the learning process of the students in engineering education. The questions that teachers had to answer, from a pedagogical and technological perspective, are related to how chatbots can be integrated into the curriculum to enhance the efficiency of engineering education, their potential impact on the learning process, and actual examples of possible learning activities using AI-based chatbots in their courses.

AB  - Flipped Learning (FL) inverts traditional teaching by delivering content online outside the classroom, allowing class time for interactive, hands-on activities. This approach enhances student engagement and understanding. The integration of AI in education has revolutionized traditional teaching methods. Enhancing FL with AI has led to the emergence of what was labeled in this research paper as Flipped Interactive Learning (FIL), which integrates AI-driven tools to support and enrich interactive, personalized learning experiences. This study aimed to examine the impact of the FIL instructional model based on Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) on students’ programming skills in an undergraduate course. The participants in this study were 74 students. This study used a semi-experimental research design; the control group consisted of 36 students, while the experimental group consisted of 38 students. The experimental group received instruction using the FIL method while the control group received instruction using the conventional FL method. The analysis of the collected data showed that using FIL-based ChatGPT contributed significantly to improving students’ programming skills. Based on the findings of this study, educational institutions should adopt the FIL instructional model in academic settings in general and programming courses in particular, as it significantly improves student learning outcomes compared to conventional FL methods. In addition, institutions should also evaluate the FIL model’s scalability and allocate necessary resources, such as technology infrastructure and support staff, for successful implementation. Further research should identify the most effective components of the FIL model to refine it for broader use. Moreover, continuous student feedback is essential for iterative improvements to meet their needs.

PY  - 2023
AB  - Although automatic dialogue tutors hold great potential in making education personalized and more accessible, research on such systems has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently large and high-quality datasets. However, collecting such datasets remains challenging, as recording tutoring sessions raises privacy concerns and crowdsourcing leads to insufficient data quality. To address this problem, we propose a framework to semi-synthetically generate such dialogues by pairing real teachers with a large language model (LLM) scaffolded to represent common student errors. In this paper, we describe our ongoing efforts to use this framework to collect MathDial, a dataset of currently ca. 1.5k tutoring dialogues grounded in multi-step math word problems. We show that our dataset exhibits rich pedagogical properties, focusing on guiding students using sense-making questions to let them explore problems. Moreover, we outline that MathDial and its grounding annotations can be used to finetune language models to be more effective tutors (and not just solvers) and highlight remaining challenges that need to be addressed by the research community. We will release our dataset publicly to foster research in this socially important area of NLP.

Although AI makes education more accessible and efficient, the intentional misuse of AI chatbots in facilitating academic cheating has become a growing concern. By using the indirect questioning technique via a list experiment to minimize social desirability bias, this research contributes to the ongoing dialog on academic integrity in the era of AI. Our findings reveal that students conceal AI-powered academic cheating behaviors when directly questioned, as the prevalence of cheaters observed via list experiments is almost threefold the prevalence of cheaters observed via the basic direct questioning approach. Interestingly, our subsample analysis shows that AI-powered academic cheating behaviors differ significantly across genders and grades, as higher-grade female students are more likely to cheat than newly enrolled female students. Conversely, male students consistently engage in academic cheating throughout all grades. Furthermore, we discuss potential reasons for the heterogeneous effects in academic cheating behavior among students such as gender disparity, academic-related pressure, and peer effects. Implications are also suggested for educational institutions to promote innovative approaches that harness the benefits of AI technologies while safeguarding academic integrity.

AB  - In 2003, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) stopped using the term "underrepresented minority" and instead adopted "underrepresented in medicine." This was not the first time the AAMC revised this definition. In this article, the authors call on the AAMC to revise and expand this definition to include another group that is underrepresented in medicine: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals. It is difficult to know whether LGBTQ populations are underrepresented in medicine; however, the data that do exist suggest a significant lack of LGBTQ representation in medicine. It is unclear if this underrepresentation is due to a true numerical lack of LGBTQ physicians, to LGBTQ physicians not publicly self-identifying due to anti-LGBTQ sentiments and reactions, or to both. The authors urge the AAMC to take 3 actions: to anonymously and sensitively poll physicians nationwide to obtain a better estimate of the current number of LGBTQ physicians, to formulate improved standards for an LGBTQ health curriculum for all medical trainees to consistently produce LGBTQ-competent physicians, and to once again expand its definition of underrepresented in medicine to include LGBTQ populations. Such a change to this definition would likely lead to concerted efforts to increase the number of LGBTQ physicians, which could then lead to increased visibility, inclusivity, and mentorship programs where LGBTQ trainees could thrive. With these 3 actions, the authors believe that the AAMC has the opportunity to forge a path forward that is not only beneficial to LGBTQ trainees but also to LGBTQ patients who currently face a myriad of health disparities due to the lack of LGBTQ-identifying and LGBTQ-competent physicians.

AB  - Recessive loss-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase 2 (GPT2) cause intellectual disability in children. Given this cognitive disorder, and because glutamate metabolism is tightly regulated to sustain excitatory neurotransmission, here we investigate the role of GPT2 in synaptic function. GPT2 catalyzes a reversible reaction interconverting glutamate and pyruvate with alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate, a TCA cycle intermediate; thereby, GPT2 may play an important role in linking mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with synaptic transmission. In mouse brain, we find that GPT2 is enriched in mitochondria of synaptosomes (isolated synaptic terminals). Loss of Gpt2 in mouse appears to lead to reprogramming of glutamate and glutamine metabolism, and to decreased glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in pyramidal neurons of CA1 hippocampal slices from Gpt2-null mice reveal decreased excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) without changes in mEPSC frequency, or importantly, changes in inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs). Additional evidence of defective glutamate release included reduced levels of glutamate released from Gpt2-null synaptosomes measured biochemically. Glutamate release from synaptosomes was rescued to wild-type levels by alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation. Additionally, we observed evidence of altered metabolism in isolated Gpt2-null synaptosomes: decreased TCA cycle intermediates, and increased glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Notably, alterations in the TCA cycle and the glutamine pool were alleviated by alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation. In conclusion, our data support a model whereby GPT2 mitochondrial activity may contribute to glutamate availability in pre-synaptic terminals, thereby highlighting potential interactions between pre-synaptic mitochondrial metabolism and synaptic transmission.

AB  - This study addresses the need for research that incorporates educational perspectives and theories to understand the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on learning and teaching. Utilizing AI-integrated mathematical problem-posing (AIM) activities and the AI-powered scaffolding (AIS) strategy, the research investigated preservice teachers’ (PTs’) experiences with AI and their capacity for error recognition and correction in problems posed by ChatGPT. The findings reveal that while the PTs excelled at verifying error-free problems, they struggled significantly with identifying and correcting errors, indicating a gap in their instructional preparedness. The study demonstrates that AIM activities are effective tools for assessing and developing PTs’ error recognition and correction skills. Additionally, AIM activities support the transfer of mathematical knowledge to pedagogical and instructional practices, contributing to PTs’ growth as adaptable educators. The research highlights the need to integrate AI-based activities into PT training to build robust mathematical knowledge and teaching skills. Focusing on learning, pedagogy, and the human aspects of technology use, AIM activities and the AIS strategy enable PTs to engage critically with AI outputs and enhance their metacognitive skills. These insights emphasize the importance of incorporating AI-integrated methods into teacher preparation programs to better equip future educators for an AI-driven educational landscape.

AB  - This systematic review examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in English language teaching (ELT), analyzing AI tools, applications, and their pedagogical outcomes. AI technologies, such as chatbots, intelligent tutoring systems, and speech recognition software, are increasingly used to enhance language learning experiences. The review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model, a standardized approach that ensures transparency and rigor in identifying, screening, and analyzing relevant literature. PRISMA emphasizes clear documentation of the selection process, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, to provide a systematic and replicable methodology for comprehensive reviews. Through thematic qualitative analysis of recent literature indexed in Scopus and Web of Science, key themes emerged regarding AI types, applications, teacher and learner perspectives, and ethical considerations. Findings reveal that AI tools enhance learner engagement, provide personalized learning experiences, and improve language proficiency, particularly in speaking and writing. However, challenges remain, such as accessibility barriers, teacher preparedness, and ethical concerns around data privacy and bias. This review proposes a framework for AI integration in ELT, focusing on access, teacher training, ethical standards, and blended learning models to optimize AI’s benefits. The study underscores the need for targeted teacher training and ethical standards to maximize AI’s effectiveness and sustainability in ELT. This framework and the review findings aim to support educators, developers, and policymakers in fostering an AI-enriched learning environment that aligns with educational goals while addressing existing limitations.

AB  - This study assessed the effectiveness of AI and AI-related technologies in the daily educational activities of undergraduate students in a modern and diversified university environment. The participants were 13 undergraduate Indonesian students participating in a mobility program for two weeks in Malaysia. A survey questionnaire designed with the help of the existing literature and ChatGPT, which includes ten (10) structured items and seven (7) open-ended questions, was used to collect the data. The relevant SPSS tests were used to analyze the data. Based on the results, of all 13 participants, 12 (92.3%) of them already experienced AI in their daily educational activities, and there were strong positive correlations between the attitudes toward AI and AI experiences, and attitudes toward AI and the effects of AI on education attributes, with correlation scores of .663 and .833 respectively. Based on the participant's answers to the qualitative questions, most of them believed that AI and AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, are helpful in daily educational activities and help them gain information regardless of time and space limitations and do their university-related assignments quickly. Based on the results, AI and AI-related technologies could transform different aspects of modern education.

AB  - Purpose: To assess obstetrician-gynecologist (Ob/Gyn) resident experiences with and preferences for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) healthcare training. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was deployed to residents from accredited Illinois Ob/Gyn training programs. The survey included 32 questions on resident demographics, LGBTQ training, and self-perceived preparedness in providing LGBTQ patient care. Results: Of 257 eligible Ob/Gyn residents, 105 (41%) responded. Fifty percent of residents felt unprepared to care for lesbian or bisexual patients and 76% felt unprepared to care for transgender patients. Feeling prepared to provide care for lesbian or bisexual patients was associated with attending a university-based program, working in a hospital without religious affiliation, and year of training. Feeling prepared to provide healthcare for transgender patients correlated with grand rounds focused on LGBTQ health and supervised clinical involvement. Regarding training, 62% and 63% of participants stated their programs dedicate 1–5 h per year to lesbian/bisexual healthcare and transgender healthcare training, respectively. Concurrently, 92% desired more education on how to provide healthcare to LGBTQ patients. Perceived barriers to receiving training in LGBTQ healthcare included curricular crowding (85%) and lack of experienced faculty (91%). Conclusion: Our assessment indicates Illinois Ob/Gyn residents feel inadequately prepared to address healthcare needs of LGBTQ patients. Although barriers exist, residents desire more education and training in providing healthcare to the LGBTQ community. Future work is needed to address this gap through curricular development to ensure that Ob/Gyn residency graduates are prepared care for LGBTQ patients.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have been implemented across all levels of education, with the rapid developments of chatbots and AI language models, like ChatGPT, demonstrating the urgent need to conceptualize the key debates and their implications for a new era of learning and assessment. This adoption occurs in a context where AI is dramatically remapping "the human,"the purposes of schooling, and pedagogy. Focus of Study: The paper examines how different formulations of "human"became interwoven with the sliding signifier of "intelligence"through a series of violent exclusions, and how the shifting contour of "intelligence"produces uneven and unjust ontological scales undergirding both education and AI fields. Its purpose is to engage the education research community in dialogue about biases, the nature of ethics, and decision-making concerning AI in education. Research Design: This paper adapts a historical-philosophical method. It traces the effects of colonialism and racialization within humanism's emergence through Sylvia Wynter's historiography of "figure of Man,"especially via the invention of "intelligence,"which has linked education and computer science. It also investigates themes central to modern education such as justice, equity, and in/exclusion through a philosophical examination of the ontological scales of "human."Conclusions: After outlining how "intelligence"has shifted from reason-as-morality to concepts of natural intelligence, we argue that current examples of AI in Education (AIEd), like classroom chatbots and social agents, constitute an intermediary point in the arc toward a new computational superintelligence-the emergence of man3- illustrating the opportunities, risks, and ethical issues in pedagogical applications based on emotion. We outline three differing visions of AIEd's future, concluding with a series of provocations (onto-epistemological, practice-based, and purposes of schooling) that exceed such models and that, given rapid innovations in machine learning, require urgent consideration from multiple stakeholders.

AB  - Identifying and annotating student use of debugging strategies when solving computer programming problems can be a meaningful tool for studying and better understanding the development of debugging skills, which may lead to the design of effective pedagogical interventions. However, this process can be challenging when dealing with large datasets, especially when the strategies of interest are rare but important. This difficulty lies not only in the scale of the dataset but also in operationalizing these rare phenomena within the data. Operationalization requires annotators to first define how these rare phenomena manifest in the data and then obtain a sufficient number of positive examples to validate that this definition is reliable by accurately measuring Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR). This paper presents a method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently exclude computer programming episodes that are unlikely to exhibit a specific debugging strategy. By using LLMs to filter out irrelevant programming episodes, this method focuses human annotation efforts on the most pertinent parts of the dataset, enabling experts to operationalize the coding scheme and reach IRR more efficiently.

AB  - Introduction: Sexual minority young adults are at increased risk for suicidal ideation (SI) compared with heterosexual young adults. Though several frameworks exist to explain the development of suicide risk, including the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) and the Minority Stress Model, few studies have examined these frameworks simultaneously. This study examines these frameworks longitudinally among sexual minority young adults. Methods: A total of 792 sexual minority young adults (50% bisexual+, 50% gay/lesbian) completed an online survey at baseline, one-month follow-up, and two-month follow-up assessing constructs related to IPTS, the minority stress model, and SI. Results: Over half of our sample (52.9%) reported any SI at baseline. In the full sample, all types of minority stress at baseline were significantly associated with SI at two-month follow-up via perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belongingness (TB) at one-month follow-up. In the bisexual+ subsample, all bisexual-specific minority stressors at baseline were significantly associated with SI at two-month follow-up via PB at one-month follow-up; internalized binegativity was also associated with SI via TB. However, effects became non-significant when controlling for previous levels of the mediators and outcome variables. Conclusion: Both minority stress and IPTS are relevant for understanding suicide risk among sexual minority young adults.

AB  - The burgeoning role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education prompts crucial discussions regarding its implications for teaching and learning. This qualitative study probes the argumentative perspectives of 118 teacher candidates from Iğdır University on the integration of AI into educational practices. Employing Toulmin's (1958) model, we analyzed their arguments, which encompass claims, evidence, warrants, backings, rebuttals, and conclusions, to ascertain their stance on AI's pedagogical integration. Utilizing four distinct AI chatbots—GPT-4, Gemini AI, Claude 3 Haiku, and Mistral AI—the research deciphers thematic undercurrents within these dimensions. Moreover, a novel methodological contribution is made through 'negative space exploration', focusing on the unmentioned themes to identify latent biases and assumptions in the argumentation. The study's dual analytical approach, combining AI-driven theme identification and negative space exploration, resulted in an enriched understanding of the content. Key findings suggest a nuanced perception among participants: while AI chatbots are acknowledged for enhancing educational efficiency and enabling personalized learning, concerns regarding diminished human interaction, potential erosion of critical thinking skills, and ethical use persist. The analyses also highlight the need for a balanced AI implementation that supports, not supplants, traditional educational methods. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on effective AI integration in education and calls for responsible pedagogical adoption of AI technologies.

Method: Community/college adults who identified as sexual minorities (N = 231) completed a survey examining suicide-related risk factors. Results: Greater discrimination and less social support from friends and significant others were associated with greater odds of lifetime SA for both groups, whereas greater emotion dysregulation and rumination were only associated with greater odds of lifetime SA for bisexual/pansexual individuals. Conclusion: There are common and unique risk factors for SA among subgroups of sexual minorities, which may have intervention implications.

AB  - While research on Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) focuses more on the male-against-female case, the examination of same-sex couples is limited. We examined bystanders' evaluations towards gay-men victims of IPV. One hundred and fifty-eight Italian undergraduates (124 females, 33 males, 1 unknown; mean age = 21.37; SD = 2.18) voluntary read a fictitious article of IPV in which gay-men victims - described as feminine vs. masculine - admitted or not the infidelity. They evaluated victims and expressed their willingness to provide help. Results showed that being unfaithful leads to evaluate victims as less moral, more responsible for the violence, and these evaluations affect bystanders' willingness to support victims. Despite differences in evaluations of feminine/masculine gay-men emerged, gender-role expression did not moderate the pattern of findings.

AB  - As Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances technologically, it will inevitably bring many changes to classroom practices. However, research on AI in education reflects a weak connection to pedagogical perspectives or instructional approaches, particularly in K-12 education. AI technologies may benefit motivated and advanced students. Understanding the teacher’s role of student motivation in mediating and supporting learning with AI technologies in the classroom is needed. This study used self-determination theory as the undergirding framework to investigate how teacher support moderates the effects of student expertise on needs satisfactions and intrinsic motivation to learn with AI technologies. This experimental study involved 123 Grade 10 students, and used chatbots as AI-based technologies in the experiment. The analyses revealed that intrinsic motivation and competence to learn with the chatbot depended on both teacher support and student expertise (i.e. self-regulated learning and digital literacy), and the teacher support better satisfied the need for relatedness, and it less satisfied the need for autonomy. The findings refined our understanding about the application of self-determination theory and expand the pedagogical and design considerations of AI application and instructional practices.

AB  - Pedagogical conversational agents (CA) support formal and informal learning to help students achieve better learning outcomes by providing information, guidance or fostering reflections. Even though the extant literature suggests that pedagogical CAs can improve learning outcomes, there exists little empirical evidence of what design features drive this effect. This study reports on an exploratory field experiment involving 31 pupils in commercial high schools and finds that students achieved better learning outcomes when preparing for their tests with a pedagogical CA than without. However, the drivers of this effect remain unclear. Neither the use frequency of the design features nor the pupils' expectations towards the CA could explain the improvement in marks. However, for the subjective perception of learning achievement, pupils' expectations was a significant predictor. These findings provide support for the use of pedagogical CAs in teaching but also highlight that the drivers of better learning outcomes still remain unknown.

AB  - The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured public imagination and represent a marked improvement in AI in Education (AIED) capabilities. But there is concern that student reliance on automated tools to complete written assignments may lead to a decline in learning. This study investigated whether participant use of LLMs to complete a writing assignment affected retention of learning content. Undergraduate participants (N= 109) were randomly assigned to complete a writing assignment under one of three conditions: (1), with the assistance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based AI psychology tutor; (2) with the assistance of unmodified GPT-4 Turbo; (3) with no AI assistance. After completing the writing task, students completed a posttest quiz to assess their retention of learning material. The control condition had the lowest mean quiz score (M= 9.22, SD = 3.90), followed by the RAG AI tutor condition (M = 10.81, SD = 4.12), and unmodified GPT-4Turbo (M= 11.31, SD = 3.88), with significant differences between the AI tutor condition and the control condition (p =.036); and between the GPT-4 Turbo condition and control (p =.003); but not between the AI tutor and GPT-4 Turbo conditions (p=.283).

AB  - Background: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in Asian universities struggles to integrate Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA) due to large classes and student reluctance. While ChatGPT offers solutions, its conventional use may hinder independent critical thinking. Objectives: This study introduces PA-GPT, using ChatGPT as a “virtual peer” in peer assessments to promote active learning and enhance knowledge, higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), and attitudes—the core of KSA in STEM. Methods: A randomised controlled trial involved 61 first-year engineering students (43 males, 18 females) from a university in Southern Taiwan enrolled in “Network Embedded Systems and Applications.” Participants, all with prior ChatGPT experience but no programming background, were purposively sampled. They were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 31) using PA-GPT or the control group (n = 30) using traditional ChatGPT. Over 8 weeks, data were collected using pre- and post-tests: a knowledge construction test (20 items, α = 0.85); a HOTS scale (α = 0.78–0.83) measuring critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity; and the S-STEM questionnaire (α >0.80) assessing attitudes towards STEM subjects and 21st-century learning. ANCOVA analysed the data, controlling for pre-test scores, and Levene's test checked homogeneity of variances. Results and Conclusions: ANCOVA results showed that PA-GPT significantly outperformed traditional ChatGPT in enhancing knowledge construction (F = 9.89, p = 0.002), critical thinking (F = 37.00, p < 0.001), problem-solving (F = 9.40, p = 0.003), creativity (F = 7.22, p = 0.009), and attitudes towards mathematics (F = 25.52, p < 0.001), engineering/technology (F = 16.06, p < 0.001), and 21st-century learning (F = 26.38, p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that PA-GPT effectively addresses challenges in student engagement and HOTS development in STEM education by simulating peer interactions. Peer Assessment with ChatGPT (PA-GPT) promotes active learning and self-reflection, potentially revolutionising AI-assisted education in large class settings. This study provides pioneering evidence for the effectiveness of AI-driven peer assessment in enhancing comprehensive STEM competencies, offering a promising direction for future educational technology integration.

AB  - The recent surge of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education presents a fascinating landscape of opportunities and challenges. AI has the potential to personalize education and create more engaging learning experiences. However, the effectiveness of AI interventions relies on well-considered implementation strategies. The impact of AI platforms in education is largely determined by the particular learning environment and the distinct needs of each student. Consequently, investigating the attitudes of future educators towards this technology is becoming a critical area of research. This study explores the impact of generative AI platforms on students’ learning performance, experience, and satisfaction within higher education. It specifically focuses on students’ experiences with varying levels of technological proficiency. A comparative study was conducted with two groups from different academic contexts undergoing the same experimental condition to design, develop, and implement instructional design projects using various AI platforms to produce multimedia content tailored to their respective subjects. Undergraduates from two disciplines—Early Childhood Education (n = 32) and Computer Science (n = 34)—participated in this study, which examined the integration of generative AI platforms into educational content implementation. Results indicate that both groups demonstrated similar learning performance in designing, developing, and implementing instructional design projects. Regarding user experience, the general outcomes were similar across both groups; however, Early Childhood Education students rated the usefulness of AI multimedia platforms significantly higher. Conversely, Computer Science students reported a slightly higher comfort level with these tools. In terms of overall satisfaction, Early Childhood Education students expressed greater satisfaction with AI software than their counterparts, acknowledging its importance for their future careers. This study contributes to the understanding of how AI platforms affect students from diverse backgrounds, bridging a gap in the knowledge of user experience and learning outcomes. Furthermore, by exploring best practices for integrating AI into educational contexts, it provides valuable insights for educators and scholars seeking to optimize the potential of AI to enhance educational outcomes.

AB  - The educational landscape is evolving with the integration of AI, large language models (LLMs), and generative AI, requiring educators to adopt state-of-the-art technologies and strategies in their pedagogical practices. Pedagogical Design Patterns (PDPs) have garnered attention for disseminating best practices and bridging the gap between research and practice. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by limited publicly available resources and fragmented publishing platforms. To address this, we propose leveraging LLMs to recommend pedagogical practices, drawing from existing PDPs. Our model utilizes a local knowledge base and the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to create query contexts for LLM prompts. Initial findings show promise, with an accuracy score of 0.83 and high relevance of recommendations to input queries. This study presents early results of our ongoing project, supporting further development of the model. The proposed system aims to empower novice educators by providing expert wisdom to enrich their teaching methodologies.

AB  - We have developed a chatbot that advises design students on their learning strategies through automatic interactions. We implemented a prototype of the chatbot in a sketchbook application that students utilized to receive advice during their design studies and evaluated whether it could help them to facilitate their learning strategies. The results demonstrated that, while the chatbot was generally able to create a natural dialogue flow with the students and helped to increase some learning strategies, there was still significant room for improvement. We analyzed the data on learning strategies and self-efficacy obtained from the experiments in detail and came up with a new hypothesis. That is, the experimental result indicated that chatbots can increase strategies for understanding learning progress, reflecting on learning, and devising learning methods by interacting with students in a way that gives them confidence, and we will empirically verify it in our future work.

AB  - Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) patients fear being open about their identities, not receiving equal or safe treatment, and having their family and surrogates disrespected or ignored by providers. Objective: To examine inadequate, disrespectful, and abusive care to patients and family due to sexual orientation or gender identity. Design: A cross-sectional study using an online survey. Setting/Subjects: Home and residential hospice, inpatient palliative care service, and other inpatient and outpatient settings. Subjects were 865 hospice and palliative care providers, including physicians, social workers, nurses, and chaplains. Measurements: Inadequate, disrespectful, or abusive care to LGBT patients and discriminatory treatment of family and surrogates were measured. Results: Among respondents, 53.6% thought that lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) patients were more likely than non-LGB patients to experience discrimination at their institution; 23.7% observed discriminatory care; 64.3% reported that transgender patients were more likely than nontransgender patients to experience discrimination; 21.3% observed discrimination to transgender patients; 15% observed the spouse/partner of LGBT patients having their treatment decisions disregarded or minimized; and 14.3% observed the spouse/partner or surrogate being treated disrespectfully. Conclusions: These findings provide strong evidence that LGBT patients and their families are more likely to receive discriminatory care as compared with those who are not LGBT. Disrespectful care can negatively impact the trust patients have in providers and institutions, and lead to delaying or avoiding care, or not disclosing relevant information. Partners/spouses and surrogates may be treated disrespectfully, have their treatment decisions ignored or minimized, be denied or have limited access to the patient, and be denied private time. Advocacy and staff training should address barriers to delivering respectful and nondiscriminatory care.

AB  - This study describes the primary and secondary partnerships of aging gay men participating in the Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging Among Men Who Have Sex with Men substudy of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and examines differences in the prevalence of these relationship structures by HIV status while adjusting for age, education, and race/ethnicity. Relationships were compared within the following structural categories: “only a primary partnership”, “only a secondary partnership”, “both a primary and secondary relationship”, or “neither a primary nor secondary relationship”. There were 1,054 participants (51.9% HIV negative/48.1% HIV positive) included in the study. Participants had a median age of 62.0 years (interquartile range: 56.0–67.0) and most reported being non-Hispanic white (74.6%) and college educated (88.0%). Of the 1,004 participants with available partnership status data, 384 (38.2%) reported no primary or secondary partnerships, 108 (10.8%) reported secondary-only partnership, 385 (38.3%) reported primary-only partnership, and 127 (12.6%) reported both primary and secondary partnerships. Of participants who reported primary partnerships only, the prevalence rates (PRs) were lower among those 62 years and older, HIV positive, black non-Hispanic and Hispanics. Of participants who reported only having a secondary partnership, the PRs were higher among those 62 years and older and HIV positive. Of participants who did not report having either a primary or secondary partnership, the PRs were higher among those 62 years and older, HIV positive, and black non-Hispanic compared with their respective referent groups. There was no significant difference in PRs of having both primary and secondary partnerships by age category, HIV status, race/ethnicity, and education. This study aimed to fill a knowledge gap in the literature regarding both primary and secondary supportive partnerships among aging HIV-positive and HIV-negative gay men.

AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and have been reported as major contributors to non-trauma deaths in hospitals worldwide. The cornerstones of effective treatment of IAIs include early recognition, adequate source control, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prompt physiologic stabilization using a critical care environment, combined with an optimal surgical approach. Together, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery (GAIS), the Surgical Infection Society-Europe (SIS-E), the World Surgical Infection Society (WSIS), and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) have jointly completed an international multi-society document in order to facilitate clinical management of patients with IAIs worldwide building evidence-based clinical pathways for the most common IAIs. An extensive non-systematic review was conducted using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases, limited to the English language. The resulting information was shared by an international task force from 46 countries with different clinical backgrounds. The aim of the document is to promote global standards of care in IAIs providing guidance to clinicians by describing reasonable approaches to the management of IAIs.

AB  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are designed to aid and enhance the teaching and learning process in a specific field of knowledge while acknowledging the uniqueness of each learner. Chatbots are becoming increasingly prevalent in contemporary life, with applications ranging from personal assistants on mobile devices to providing technical assistance over the phone lines in various sectors, including business, retail, health, and education. Unlike other fields, the application of chatbots in education requires careful pedagogical considerations. This article outlines a theoretical framework and theories used in developing a chatbot for the Malaysian University English Test (MUET) learning and testing, incorporating the ELTC (Education, Learning, Teaching, and Communication) Framework. The four underpinning theories of the theoretical framework in this study are education theory, language theory, technology theory, and communicative theory. The education theory adopted in this study is Lev Vygotsky's Social Constructivist Theory, aligning with the ELTC Framework's focus on active learning and interaction. The language theory involved is Krashen's Second Language Acquisition. Meanwhile, the technology theory includes Bower's Technology-Mediated Learning Theory and George Siemens's Connectivism Theory, resonating with the ELTC Framework's emphasis on utilizing technology for effective learning. The communicative theory, which highlights Social Presence Theory, underscores the importance of meaningful interaction in language learning. The suggested theoretical framework may be utilized as a reference for developing chatbot intelligent teaching systems. The chatbot can be expanded to other courses in future research. The assessment of the chatbot could be conducted with different participants and customized to meet the requirements of various learners with varying levels of language proficiency.

AB  - The adoption of chatbots in education is steadily increasing, offering a myriad of benefits to learners engaging in self-directed study. However, the reliability of information provided by chatbots poses certain obstacles, particularly in subjects with high academic content such as physics. This study proposes a five-step process for constructing chatbots, enabling educators to independently develop chatbots to support self-learning among students. This process focuses on enabling chatbots to autonomously respond to physics-related inquiries, a capability often lacking in pre-built chatbots. A new chatbot for physics lessons on the conservation of energy law was developed by applying this methodology. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed chatbot, we conducted a pedagogical experimental study involving 100 tenth grade students divided into control and experimental groups. To ensure comparability between the groups, students were selected based on their physics grades and teacher feedback. Experimental data was collected through online feedback forms and a 45-minute physics test, processed using statistical techniques. The results indicate a high level of readiness among participants to utilize chatbots for self-learning and acknowledge their beneficial impact. Furthermore, students' knowledge quality improved with chatbot usage, affirming the feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating chatbots into physics education. These findings also validate the proposed five-step chatbot development process as rational and applicable.

AB  - Aural decoding skill is an important contributor to successful EFL listening comprehension. This paper first described a preliminary study involving a 12-week undergraduate flipped decoding course, based on the flipped SEF-ARCS decoding model. Although the decoding model (N = 44) was significantly more effective in supporting students' decoding performance than a conventional decoding course (N = 36), two main challenges were reported: teacher's excessive workload, and high requirement for the individual teacher's decoding skills. To address these challenges, we developed a chatbot based on the selfdetermination theory and social presence theory to serve as a 24/7 conversational agent, and adapted the flipped decoding course to a fully online chatbot-supported learning course to reduce the dependence on the teacher. Although results revealed that the chatbot-supported fully online group (N = 46) and the flipped group (N = 43) performed equally well in decoding test, the chatbot-supported fully online approach was more effective in supporting students' behavioral and emotional engagement than the flipped learning approach. Students' perceptions of the chatbot-supported decoding activities were also explored. This study provides a useful pedagogical model involving the innovative use of chatbot to develop undergraduate EFL aural decoding skills in a fully online environment.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This mixed-methods study aims to examine factors influencing academicians’ intentions to continue using AI-based chatbots by integrating the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model and social network characteristics. Background AI-powered chatbots are gaining popularity across industries, including academia. However, empirical research on academicians’ adoption behavior is limited. This study proposes an integrated model incorporating TTF factors and social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness to understand academics’ continuance intentions. Methodology A qualitative study involving 31 interviews of academics from India examined attitudes and the potential role of social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness in adoption. Results showed positive sentiment towards chatbots and themes on how peer groups accelerate diffusion. In the second phase, a survey of 448 faculty members from prominent Indian universities was conducted to test the proposed research model. Contribution The study proposes and validates an integrated model of TTF and social network factors that influence academics’ continued usage intentions toward AI chatbots. It highlights the nuanced role of peer networks in shaping adoption. Findings Task and technology characteristics positively affected academics’ intentions to continue AI chatbot usage. Among network factors, density showed the strongest effect on TTF and perceived usefulness, while homophily and connectedness had partial effects. The study provides insights into designing appropriate AI tools for the academic context. Recommendations AI chatbot designers should focus on aligning features to academics’ task for Practitioners needs and preferences. Compatibility with academic work culture is critical. Given peer network influences, training and demonstrations to user groups can enhance adoption. Platforms should have capabilities for collaborative use. Targeted messaging customized to disciplines can resonate better with academic subgroups. Multidisciplinary influencers should be engaged. Concerns like plagiarism risks, privacy, and job impacts should be transparently addressed. Recommendations More studies are needed across academic subfields to understand nuanced for Researchers requirements and barriers. Further studies are recommended to investigate differences across disciplines and demographics, relative effects of specific network factors like size, proximity, and frequency of interaction, the role of academic leadership and institutional policies in enabling chatbot adoption, and how AI training biases impact usefulness perceptions and ethical issues. Impact on Society Increased productivity in academia through the appropriate and ethical use of AI can enhance quality, access, and equity in education. AI can assist in mundane tasks, freeing academics’ time for higher-order objectives like critical thinking development. Responsible AI design and policies considering socio-cultural aspects will benefit sustainable growth. With careful implementation, it can make positive impacts on student engagement, learning support, and research efficiency. Future Research Conduct longitudinal studies to examine the long-term impacts of AI chatbot usage in academia. Track usage behaviors over time as familiarity develops. Investigate differences across academic disciplines and roles. Requirements may vary for humanities versus STEM faculty or undergraduate versus graduate students. Assess user trust in AI and how it evolves with repeated usage, and examine trust-building strategies. Develop frameworks to assess pedagogical effectiveness and ethical risks of conversational agents in academic contexts.

AB  - To emulate the interactivity of in-person math instruction, we developed MathBot, a rule-based chatbot that explains math concepts, provides practice questions, and offers tailored feedback. We evaluated MathBot through three Amazon Mechanical Turk studies in which participants learned about arithmetic sequences. In the first study, we found that more than 40% of our participants indicated a preference for learning with MathBot over videos and written tutorials from Khan Academy. The second study measured learning gains, and found that MathBot produced comparable gains to Khan Academy videos and tutorials. We solicited feedback from users in those two studies to emulate a real-world development cycle, with some users finding the lesson too slow and others finding it too fast. We addressed these concerns in the third and main study by integrating a contextual bandit algorithm into MathBot to personalize the pace of the conversation, allowing the bandit to either insert extra practice problems or skip explanations. We randomized participants between two conditions in which actions were chosen uniformly at random (i.e., a randomized A/B experiment) or by the contextual bandit. We found that the bandit learned a similarly effective pedagogical policy to that learned by the randomized A/B experiment while incurring a lower cost of experimentation. Our findings suggest that personalized conversational agents are promising tools to complement existing online resources for math education, and that data-driven approaches such as contextual bandits are valuable tools for learning effective personalization.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) present a transformative opportunity to address longstanding challenges in computing education. This paper presents a conversational AI extension to an LLM-enhanced C/C++ compiler which generates pedagogically sound programming error explanations. Our new tool, DCC Sidekick, retains compiler integration, allowing students to see their code, error messages, and stack frames alongside a conversational AI interface. Compiler context improves error explanations, and provides a seamless development experience. We present quantitative analyses of Sidekick’s usage and engagement patterns in a large CS1 course. In the first seven weeks of use, 959 students initiated 11,222 DCC Sidekick sessions, generating 17,982 error explanations. Over half of all conversations occur outside of business hours, highlighting the value of these always-available tools. Early results indicate strong adoption of conversational AI debugging tools, demonstrating scalability in supporting large CS1 courses. We share implementation details and lessons learned, offering guidance to educators considering integrating AI tools with pedagogical guardrails.

AB  - Responsive teaching promotes students' mathematical reasoning and positive attitudes toward mathematics. Due to the complexity of the work of teaching, preservice teachers (PSTs) have been provided with approximated opportunities to practice responsive teaching skills in teacher education programs. Although increasing demand for adaptive learning reinforces the need for research on artificial intelligence (AI) in education, there have been few approaches that engaged learners in meaningful interactions. Our goal was to develop an AI-based chatbot that engaged PSTs in an authentic, meaningful, and open-ended teaching situation to enhance PSTs' responsive teaching skills, specifically questioning skills through approximations of practice. The chatbot was designed to act as a virtual student who displayed misconceptions on the topic of fractions. By employing design-based research, we examined 1) design features and structure of the chatbot, 2) coverage of users' input, 3) PSTs' questioning patterns, and 4) users' experiences. Two iterations of design, implementation and evaluation took place in an elementary mathematics education methods course. To build the chatbot we qualitatively analyzed the training data, categorized them into the smallest meaningful intents of users, and prepared corresponding responses to each intent. At the final iteration, the refined chatbot adequately covered PSTs’ questions and provided realistic responses. We found a pattern of PSTs asking similar questions repeatedly in the conversation data. Through multiple iterations, certain design features could lead to improved questioning patterns and user perceptions, including sequential responses, informing responses, and personification. Implications, design features, and limitations are discussed.

AB  - This paper discusses the ethical considerations surrounding generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in chemistry education, aiming to guide teachers toward responsible AI integration. GenAI, driven by advanced AI models like Large Language Models, has shown substantial potential in generating educational content. However, this technology's rapid rise has brought forth ethical concerns regarding general and educational use that require careful attention from educators. The UNESCO framework on GenAI in education provides a comprehensive guide to controversies around generative AI and ethical educational considerations, emphasizing human agency, inclusion, equity, and cultural diversity. Ethical issues include digital poverty, lack of national regulatory adaptation, use of content without consent, unexplainable models used to generate outputs, AI-generated content polluting the internet, lack of understanding of the real world, reducing diversity of opinions, and further marginalizing already marginalized voices and generating deep fakes. The paper delves into these eight controversies, presenting relevant examples from chemistry education to stress the need to evaluate AI-generated content critically. The paper emphasizes the importance of relating these considerations to chemistry teachers' content and pedagogical knowledge and argues that responsible AI usage in education must integrate these insights to prevent the propagation of biases and inaccuracies. The conclusion stresses the necessity for comprehensive teacher training to effectively and ethically employ GenAI in educational practices.

AB  - Since late 2022, access to Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini has become more widespread. This new phenomenon raises questions about the real impact of Gen-AI, including Large Language Models (LLM), especially on learning. Although we are facing a quite new phenomenon, a better understanding of the impact of Gen-AI on learning can be suggested by considering how other forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been studied. Based on a systematic review approach, our study shows that most existing researches focus on the evaluation of AI that is dedicated to education (AIED), and do not consider AI devices designed for broader applications. Above all, the systematic review identifies more than forty indicators used in the assessments of the impact of AI on learning; indicators that can be grouped into six key dimensions: technological, learning achievement, pedagogical, interaction, affective, metacognitive. This provides a relevant framework and a solid basis for future evaluations of the impact of Gen-AI on learning.

AB  - Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have led to significant transformations across industries and society, including the field of education. The integration of AI in educational settings has the potential to improve students' learning experience and support their individual competencies when paired with non-AI methods. Despite the growing importance of AI in modern education, there remains a noticeable research gap regarding its use in entrepreneurship education and the effects of Chatbots on students' entrepreneurial competencies. To address this gap, an exploratory study was conducted on undergraduate students who were tasked with using ChatGPT to improve their business model canvas. Design/methodology/approach: The chosen methodology aligned with the research purpose, aiming to explore the relationship between Generative AI and competencies. Due to the novel nature of the research problem, an exploratory study was conducted using a mixed methods approach. A survey with open- and closed-ended questions was designed, and statistical and text analyses were performed to interpret data and test identified propositions. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that ChatGPT can enhance the types of students' entrepreneurial competencies considered in this study: spotting opportunities, creativity, vision, valuing ideas and ethical and sustainable thinking. The results show that ChatGPT can be particularly helpful to improve the ability of students of valuing ideas. Originality/value: Overall, this study highlights the potential of adopting ChatGPT in experiential learning methodologies for enhancing students' entrepreneurial competencies and improving their learning outcomes.

AB  - Large language models(LLMs) are transforming how teachers work. In this paper, we observe several experimental approaches to generating software programming exercises by utilizing ChatGPT, a popular and open LLM. The generation of these exercises was tightly connected to a large Python programming course that was targeted at students studying in Information Technology, Software Engineering, and Computing. We experimented with three separate approaches. In the first one, we generated new programming exercises with a specific topic using theme injection. In the second one, we generated variations of existing programming exercises by changing the theme or content. In the third one, we generated hybrid exercises by injecting original programming exercises with additional topics or other related exercises. Based on our results, all three approaches showed potential but also revealed limitations. The exercise generation with theme injection can produce fully functional exercises. However, these exercises could appear to students as too generic or erroneous. The exercise variations seem to retain the semantic meaning of the original exercise quite well while still using different context. We also tested the variations in a large introductory programming course and found out that the students could not distinguish them from human-generated exercises in style or quality. The hybrid exercises were built upon the idea of exploring how close we are to fully adaptive learning environments in the field of programming education. The current results of this approach show that we need to do further experimentation to maybe reach the goal. All in all, it was evident that LLMs can be a useful tool in assisting teachers in generating exercises. Even with certain coherent limitations, they are useful in particular cases. We conclude our article by discussing the future possibilities of LLMs, including but not limited to dynamic, automatically generated exercises and fully adaptive learning environments.

AB  - While there is an increasing emphasis on preparing students for modern digital tools such as AI, educators face the dilemma of weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of this technology, including the problem of detecting its misuse. The authentic use of AI tools in education is an urgent requirement recently attracting significant attention. In this work, we are interested in the cyber security discipline and pedagogical approaches that may respond to the abovementioned challenge, focussing on assessment design tailored to integrating generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and the issue of their misuse in creating student assignments. We report on a case study involving a network and information security postgraduate module where students were educated about these tools and how they can help brainstorm ideas, outline reports, and fix grammatical mistakes in English writing. Apart from submitting reports, there were two additional components for their assessment: a viva session and a hands-on student demonstration. We argue that our approach can successfully assess authentic AI use. In addition, student feedback shows high satisfaction with the revised assess- ment format, the one-to-one interactions with lecturers and the role-play aspect of vivas. An analysis of assessment outcomes also indicates improved module performance. Our case study demonstrates the possibility of embracing AI in cyber security education while respecting its ethical use, with the additional benefits of enhancing student experience and academic performance.

AB  - LLM-based chatbots enable students to get immediate, interactive help on homework assignments, but even a thoughtfully-designed bot may not serve all pedagogical goals. We report here on the development and deployment of a GPT-4-based interactive homework assistant (“61A Bot”) for students in a large CS1 course; over 2000 students made over 100,000 requests of our Bot across two semesters. Our assistant offers one-shot, contextual feedback within the command-line “autograder” students use to test their code. Our Bot wraps student code in a custom prompt that supports our pedagogical goals and avoids providing solutions directly. Analyzing student feedback, questions, and autograder data, we find reductions in homework-related question rates in our course forum, as well as reductions in homework completion time when our Bot is available. For students in the 50tℎ − 80tℎ percentile, reductions can exceed 30 minutes per assignment, up to 50% less time than students at the same percentile rank in prior semesters. Finally, we discuss these observations, potential impacts on student learning, and other potential costs and benefits of AI assistance in CS1.

AB  - In 2023, we developed and deployed AI-based tools in CS50 at Harvard University to provide students with 24/7 interactive assistance, approximating a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio. These tools offer code explanations, style suggestions, and responses to course-related inquiries, emulating human educators to foster critical thinking. However, maintaining alignment with instructional goals is challenging, especially with frequent updates to the underlying large language models (LLMs). We thus propose a continuous improvement process for LLM-based systems using a collaborative human-in-the-loop approach. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework for assessing and refining the performance of AI-based tutors, combining human-graded and model-graded evaluations. Using few-shot prompting and fine-tuning, we aim to ensure our AI tools adopt pedagogically sound teaching styles. Fine-tuning with a small, high-quality dataset has shown significant improvements in aligning with teaching goals, as confirmed through multi-turn conversation evaluations. Additionally, our framework includes a model-evaluation backend that teaching assistants periodically review, ensuring the AI system remains effective and aligned with instructional objectives. This paper offers insights into our methods and the impact of these AI tools on CS50 and contributes to the discourse on AI in education, showcasing scalable, personalized learning enhancements.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools are used to aid the learning and teaching process in higher education. AI technology aims to assist doctoral co-supervision through the model of humanised collaboration. It is discovered that there is a lack of literature review integrating generative AI (GenAI) with doctoral co-supervision processes. This paper investigates how GenAI facilitates the doctoral co-supervision process, including types of AI used, AI in education (AIED) components integration and the extent to which AI applications are useful in doctoral co-supervision. Four research questions posed have guided the study. The findings show AI to be supportive of personalised instruction and assessment and to be used as a collaborative tool. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms with a predictive nature were of immense aid in personalised advice. Nevertheless, the experience of the fusion of AI and mobile technologies in academic mentoring is relatively scarce in empirical studies. It was found that extended case studies and consumer experience were lacking in this area. Even though the potential benefits were clarified, a comprehensive assessment of the dynamic effects called for by more robust empirical investigations is required, considering further constraints. This paper summarises that future investigations and research are still needed.

AB  - This study investigates the efficacy of large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots in guiding physics problem-solving, examining whether they can effectively supplement teacher-led learning. A customised chatbot was developed leveraging ChatGPT to provide step-by-step assistance through a structured problem-solving algorithm. Its impact was evaluated via an experimental study with 12th-grade physics students (N = 24) randomly assigned to a teacher-guided or chatbot-guided group for problem-solving practice. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed no significant differences in problem-solving competency between conditions. Qualitative analysis of conversational logs indicates the chatbot successfully emulated key teacher scaffolding behaviours. Our findings suggest AI tutors can deliver personalised, interactive support akin to human teachers, offering viable supplements to augment physics learning. Further research should explore optimising LLM training, human-chatbot balances, and impacts across diverse educational settings.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies based on big language models are becoming a transformative power that reshapes the future shape of education. Although the impact of GenAI on education is a key issue, there is little exploration of the challenges and response strategies of GenAI on the sustainability of education from a public perspective. This data mining study selected ChatGPT as a representative tool for GenAI. Five topics and 14 modular semantic communities of public attitudes towards using ChatGPT in education were identified through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling and the semantic network community discovery process on 40,179 user comments collected from social media platforms. The results indicate public ambivalence about whether GenAI technology is empowering or disruptive to education. On the one hand, the public recognizes the potential of GenAI in education, including intelligent tutoring, role-playing, personalized services, content creation, and language learning, where effective communication and interaction can stimulate users’ creativity. On the other hand, the public is worried about the impact of users’ technological dependence on the development of innovative capabilities, the erosion of traditional knowledge production by AI-generated content (AIGC), the undermining of educational equity by potential cheating, and the substitution of students by the passing or good performance of GenAI on skills tests. In addition, some irresponsible and unethical usage behaviors were identified, including the direct use of AIGC and using GenAI tool to pass similarity checks. This study provides a practical basis for educational institutions to re-examine the teaching and learning approaches, assessment strategies, and talent development goals and to formulate policies on the use of AI to promote the vision of AI for sustainable development in education.

AB  - This study inspires new pedagogical practices with evolving technological innovations. One example of such innovation is the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in education. The potential impact of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, on composition education has caused concerns among educators due to its human-like writing capabilities. However, there is no escape from ChatGPT-generated text, which is influenced by prompt engineering. Such engineering can lead to underlying issues in content, prompting a pedagogical opportunity for understanding human-written and AI-generated texts. Since, to this date, there is no single reliable source for identifying AI-generated text, this study introduces a pedagogical approach, DETECT, with two major goals: (1) explore the nuances that differentiate human expression from the algorithmic patterns and tendencies of generative AI writing and (2) inspire ways to integrate generative AI in composition instruction in a post-plagiarism era. Using exploratory practice research, this article examines DETECT in composition instruction of 32 students during Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. The findings showed that using DETECT improved students’ confidence in analyzing human-written and AI-generated texts, which enhanced their recognition and appreciation of their own writing voice. The study concludes with pedagogical implications for the possibilities of generative AI in writing instruction.

AB  - Since the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), education in computer science has prompted efforts to incorporate it into the educational curriculum. This innovative practice full paper presents a study into using GenAI to enhance student learning of software engineering. It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV&#x0026;V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV&#x0026;V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV&#x0026;V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.

AB  - In this article, we investigate the critical intersections of AI, academic integrity, and disability in the context of a large undergraduate course. Our aim was to adapt the course to respond to generative AI (GenAI) to avoid entrenching barriers for students, and instead teach them how to use GenAI tools in ways that deepen their learning and uphold academic honesty. Grounded in disability justice and access pedagogies, we outline five design goals centered on guidelines for AI usage, education on responsible AI use, revised assessments, support for teaching assistants (TAs), and accessible materials. These activities are detailed in our methodology. In our findings, we provide a critical reflection of the course adaptation, taking up issues such as varying levels of familiarity with GenAI, students’ capacity to engage with course changes, resistance to GenAI, instructors’ relational shifts to AI, and feelings of demoralization among the teaching team. We conclude by offering practical recommendations for educators, calling for learning communities to view this disruption as an invitation to listen to disabled students.

AB  - Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is recognized as a long-term inflammatory form of arthritis. This inflammation becomes long-lasting, and the synovial tissue thickens as a result of increased cell activity, protein production, and other variables in the joint, causing discomfort, redness, and warmth. It can also harm the joints of the hands, wrists, fingers, elbows, shoulders, toes, spinal column, and knees. Due to the autoimmune response, there is an aberrant production of inflammatory mediators such as Tumour necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-a), Interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-23), Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and Interferon (IFN)-ϒ. By inhibiting their production, those inflammatory mediators will play a pivotal role in the therapy of RA. Purpose of the Study: The goal of the current study was to explore the antirheumatic activity of Sansevieria roxburghiana using the computational docking method. Research Rationale: Administration of Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroidal medicaments, and Disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid therapies creates substantial adverse effects in people suffering with RA. To overcome the burdens and toxicity of drug products herbal medicines were taken into the field of research. Materials and Methods: For this, 14 bioactive compounds from ethanolic extract of S. roxburghiana leaves were identified using the GC-MS (Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) study and utilized as a binding compound (ligand) for biological target interactions. The crystallographic geometries of two targeted molecules, Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), have been retrieved from the PDB database. Methotrexate, a well-known medication for IL-1β and TNF-α inhibitors, was chosen as the reference for the comparative analysis. Computational docking was performed using the Autodock4 (version 1.5.6) choice based on the score functions. Results: The results displayed the binding energy as follow -10.13, -9.77, -8.98 and - 8.67 Kcal/mol of 2-isopropyl-5 methyl cyclohexyl 3-(1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-oxobutyl)-C, 3-chloro-5-cholestene, stigmasterol, and cycloartanol against IL-1 β (PDB ID: 4GAI) and standard methotrexate was -8.14 Kcal/mol. For TNF-α (PDB ID: 5M2J) the binding energy is -8.94, -8.85, -8.46, and -8.24 Kcal/mol of cycloartanol, stigmasterol, 2-isopropyl-5 methyl cyclohexyl 3-(1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-oxobutyl)-C and 3-chloro-5-cholestene by with comparing methotrexate (-8.89 Kcal/mol). Conclusion: Hence, it was indicated that the phytoconstituents of S. roxburghiana could serve as a potential approach for designing future antirheumatic drugs.

AB  - The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping various sectors, including education. This editorial explores the intersections of AI, science education, and the preparation of pre-service teachers (PSTs), questioning whether GenAI represents a truly transformative technology or merely the latest iteration of an educational hype cycle. While previous technological innovations—such as radio, television, and computers—were initially heralded as revolutionary, their impact on education has varied significantly. The emergence of GenAI, particularly large language models, introduces new possibilities for personalised learning, digital tutoring, and adaptive content generation, yet its integration into educational practice remains uneven. Despite growing societal reliance on GenAI, a substantial proportion of in-service teachers report limited use, citing a lack of training and institutional policies as key barriers. In contrast, research suggests that PSTs are already engaging with GenAI tools for lesson planning, content summarisation, and assessment preparation. This editorial underscores the need for initial teacher education (ITE) programmes to provide structured support, ensuring that PSTs develop both technical proficiency and critical AI literacy. Ethical concerns—such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and epistemic authority—must also be central to teacher training. Focusing on science education, this special issue examines the opportunities and challenges of GenAI integration. The contributions explore PSTs’ perceptions, competencies, and preparedness to implement AI-driven tools in their teaching, addressing themes such as inquiry-based learning, pedagogical content knowledge, and the evolving role of educators in AI-powered classrooms. The discussion highlights the necessity of balancing technological innovation with critical reflection, equipping future teachers to navigate the complexities of AI in education responsibly. This editorial aims to advance the dialogue on GenAI’s role in teacher preparation, urging educational institutions to proactively support PSTs in harnessing its potential while fostering a critical, ethical, and pedagogically sound approach to AI integration in science education.

AB  - The rapidly increasing importance of technology integration and generative AI in the fashion industry is prompting changes in fashion design education. This study explored a new design methodology utilizing AI for sustainable and future-oriented fashion design education. The methodology involved consulting practitioners to select ChatGPT and Midjourney as AI tools and technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge (TPACK) as the theoretical framework. An AI prompt guide was developed based on specialized books, from which an educational program was created. An experiment with 30 third- and fourth-year fashion design students showed that their overall satisfaction with AI through TPACK was 4 out of 5, suggesting that TPACK enhances students’ creativity and efficiency through generative AI. Prompt guides received a satisfaction score of 4.7, indicating their usefulness for creative and efficient design outputs. AI-powered educational programs, like ChatGPT and Midjourney, also improved student creativity and learning efficiency, with ChatGPT scoring 4.5. However, concerns about technology dependency were noted. This study offers insights into integrating the latest technology into fashion design to improve process efficiency and creative output. This study not only provides a foundation for future research on AI design methodology but also explores practical directions for sustainable design in the fashion industry.

AB  - AI is a hot topic of conversation due to recent advances in processing power and algorithms. ChatGPT is a generative pre-trained transformer-based general large language model. It creates text based on statistical probability, making it a text-generation machine. AI is not God and cannot take over the world. It does not have consciousness, free will, or intentionality. AI is preprogrammed and lacks responsibility, so the responsibility lies with the constructor or programmer. AI is not a knowledge base like Wikipedia or Encyclopaedia Britannica and does not produce truth or original works, but it produces text and can generate false information or hallucinations. There are four levels of ethics in technology engineering: built-in ethical issues, machines that incorporate ethical decisions, machines that incorporate decision algorithms, and intentionality/moral principles (which do not yet exist) AI in education is perceived as dangerous by some, due to fear of new technology, but it is important to remember that it is just a tool. Technology is an important part of education and we should look for convergence, synergies, and best usage models. AI is still young, so the ways it can be used in education are still being experimented with and defined. Customized pedagogical advice and creating original knowledge are not effective use cases for AI in education. Cheating is a concern with AI in education, but it is important to focus on the promising use cases such as Bing search, Microsoft Copilot, translation, transcription, summarization, and generating problems and questions based on examples. We cannot ban AI in education, as it has already been adopted and can increase productivity. Instead, we must learn how to use it responsibly and ethically.

AB  - This study employs Engeström’s second-generation activity theory (AT) to examine the transformative potential of Generative AI (GenAI) in providing formative feedback in higher education. Specifically, this research focuses on the experiences of fifty students with generic and calibrated GenAI feedback in a graduate program in the US. Through the analysis of participants’ multimodal views and textual reflections after their experiences with these two types of AI reviews, we uncover the role that the AI reviewer played in the peer and AI review activity system of which students were part. The examination of the semiotic elements embedded in the participants’ artifacts points to clear opinion differences in connection with the effectiveness and role of generic and calibrated AI feedback in the review activity system. The results show that while the generic AI reviewer was deemed an imperfect, limited tool, its calibrated counterpart was welcomed by students for its effectiveness and was even regarded by some participants as a new member of the community of practice within the activity system. Based on the findings resulting from this investigation, we suggest effective strategies for AI-human collaboration in higher education, aiming to enhance teaching and learning practices through advanced AI applications.

AB  - The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is poised to revolutionize medical education, clinical decision-making, and health care workflow. Despite considerable interest and a surfeit of newly available tools, medical educators largely lack both competencies and guidance on how to incorporate the new and rapidly evolving world of GAI into the core medical school curriculum and experiences of undergraduate medical education. This Scholarly Perspective highlights the need for medical schools to adapt to this new paradigm by implementing policies, governance, and curricula that address the ethical, technical, and pedagogical implications of GAI. The authors recommend creating policies for appropriate GAI use, designed to protect institutional and patient data, and provide students with clarity on the appropriate use of AI for education. The authors suggest that implementing GAI governance at institutions is crucial to create guiding principles on ethical and equitable GAI use and involving students as coinventors of local innovation. The authors argue that providing faculty and learners with tools and training for safe experimentation with GAI and defining competencies for students and faculty are essential. Curricula for GAI should focus on implications of clinical uses. The authors propose a set of new competencies for GAI that build on those already established for AI in general. Given how dynamic the world of GAI is and how quickly new innovations are changing longstanding practices of clinical medicine, it is imperative that the medical education community acts together to share best practices, gather data to assess the impact of GAI education, continuously update the expected competencies of medical students, and help students prepare for a career that will be continually changed by GAI.

AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs) in medical education offers both opportunities and challenges. While these artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools can enhance access to information and support critical thinking, they also pose risks like potential overreliance and ethical concerns. To ensure ethical use, students and instructors must recognize the limitations of LLMs, maintain academic integrity, and handle data cautiously, and instructors should prioritize content quality over AI detection methods. LLMs can be used as supplementary aids rather than primary educational resources, with a focus on enhancing accessibility and equity and fostering a culture of feedback. Institutions should create guidelines that align with their unique educational values, providing clear frameworks that support responsible LLM usage while addressing risks associated with AI in education. Such guidelines should reflect the institution’s pedagogical mission, whether centered on clinical practice, research, or a mix of both, and should be adaptable to evolving educational technologies.

AB  - Providing corrective feedback to second language (L2) writing constitutes a crucial digital affordance for AI-assisted writing systems. However, L2 writers’ revision strategies and obstacles to adopting AI-generated feedback, such as ChatGPT, remain unclear. Forty-five L2 students in a computer science program were tasked with seeking corrective feedback from ChatGPT for their argumentative essays, followed by an analysis of their revisions and rationale for feedback uptake strategies. The findings revealed that approximately 38% of the feedback was either explicitly argued (22%) or ignored (16%). Upon controlling for writing proficiency, participants statistically rejected a significantly higher proportion of feedback at the content level (e.g. evidence) than at the form level (e.g. grammar). Utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model, the reasons for rejecting or ignoring ChatGPT-generated feedback were examined through participants’ reflective data, focusing on two perspectives: inconvenience to use and unusefulness. Inconvenient factors included (1) overload feedback, (2) provision of general descriptions instead of specific error highlighting, and (3) repetitive and tedious comments. Themes related to unusefulness encompassed (1) misinterpretation of authors’ intentions, (2) lack of clarity and illustrative examples, and (3) extraneous and irrelevant feedback. The implications entail pedagogical strategies to mitigate barriers and foster feedback literacy in AI-assisted educational environment.

AB  - Background: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new avenues in educational methodologies, particularly in medical education. This study seeks to assess whether generative AI might be useful in addressing the depletion of assessment question banks, a challenge intensified during the Covid-era due to the prevalence of open-book examinations, and to augment the pool of formative assessment opportunities available to students. While many recent publications have sought to ascertain whether AI can achieve a passing standard in existing examinations, this study investigates the potential for AI to generate the exam itself. Summary of work: This research utilized a commercially available AI large language model (LLM), OpenAI GPT-4, to generate 220 single best answer (SBA) questions, adhering to Medical Schools Council Assessment Alliance guidelines the and a selection of Learning Outcomes (LOs) of the Scottish Graduate-Entry Medicine (ScotGEM) program. All questions were assessed by an expert panel for accuracy and quality. A total of 50 AI-generated and 50 human-authored questions were used to create two 50-item formative SBA examinations for Year 1 and Year 2 ScotGEM students. Each exam, delivered via the Speedwell eSystem, comprised 25 AI-generated and 25 human-authored questions presented in random order. Students completed the online, closed-book exams on personal devices under exam conditions that reflected summative examinations. The performance of both AI-generated and human-authored questions was evaluated, focusing on facility and discrimination index as key metrics. Summary of results: The screening process revealed that 69% of AI-generated SBAs were fit for inclusion in the examinations with little or no modifications required. Modifications, when necessary, were predominantly due to reasons such as the inclusion of "all of the above" options, usage of American English spellings, and non-alphabetized answer choices. 31% of questions were rejected for inclusion in the examinations, due to factual inaccuracies and non-alignment with students’ learning. When included in an examination, post hoc statistical analysis indicated no significant difference in performance between the AI- and human- authored questions in terms of facility and discrimination index. Discussion and conclusion: The outcomes of this study suggest that AI LLMs can generate SBA questions that are in line with best-practice guidelines and specific LOs. However, a robust quality assurance process is necessary to ensure that erroneous questions are identified and rejected. The insights gained from this research provide a foundation for further investigation into refining AI prompts, aiming for a more reliable generation of curriculum-aligned questions. LLMs show significant potential in supplementing traditional methods of question generation in medical education. This approach offers a viable solution to rapidly replenish and diversify assessment resources in medical curricula, marking a step forward in the intersection of AI and education.

AB  - This research full paper describes how integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in engineering education represents a transformative shift with profound implications. In this work, we outline the multifaceted impact of AI, emphasizing its benefits and potential misuse within the classroom, and extend to consider its broader societal implications. AI&#x0027;s introduction in engineering education signals a new era of personalized learning environments. Its capacity for analyzing vast data sets enables tailored educational experiences, addressing individual student needs with unprecedented precision. AI-driven tools can identify learning gaps and provide customized resources, optimizing the learning process. These advancements are not without pitfalls. A notable concern is the misuse of AI by students, such as leveraging AI to complete assignments unethically, which undermines learning objectives and academic integrity. Beyond the classroom, AI&#x0027;s influence on society, particularly in the labor market, is a double-edged sword. AI poses a threat to traditional job markets. Automation risks displacing a significant portion of the workforce, particularly in sectors reliant on routine tasks. We have emphasized the importance of a balanced approach, advocating for the responsible integration of AI in educational settings with human oversight to prevent unethical use, potential job displacement, and other societal impacts. We have also advocated for studying and designing new pedagogical approaches and courses that would integrate AI-based applications such as ChatGPT to enhance problem-solving and critical thinking among students.

AB  - The literature has reported the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for educational purposes. This article aims to discuss the potentialities and limitations of AI in lesson planning and teacher training in chemistry and science subjects. The study compares three high school Teaching Sequences (TSs) on electrolysis, developed with and without AI’s assistance. The first, H-TS, was crafted within a Brazilian university’s Chemistry Teaching program, without AI. The other two, GPT-3.5-TS and GPT-4-TS, were independently created using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, maintaining consistent lesson numbers and durations, and adhering to the same theoretical and methodological framework, including the use of a simulator. Findings indicate a marked improvement in TSs developed with GPT-4 over GPT-3.5. Nonetheless, both AIs exhibited limitations such as shallow reasoning and repetitive use of prompt terms, lacking in-depth didactic-pedagogical elaboration. They produced highly prescriptive sequences, potentially reinforcing misconceptions, and displayed a relative disregard for the educational context─aspects present to a lesser extent in H-TS. On a positive note, AIs demonstrated strong organizational skills, relatively adequate framework mapping, and diverse instructional and assessment strategies. The study suggests a moderate and formative use of AIs in educational contexts. It underscores the necessity for teachers to critically engage with AI-generated content and iteratively use AI to refine sequences, ensuring these do not become final products. Future research should explore AI’s practical application in TS development and its impact on preservice teacher training, aiming to critically assess and address the complexities and implications of AI-generated TSs.

AB  - Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student’s error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4’s annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

AB  - Introduction: The growing presence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in our society, particularly in the educational field, is undeniable. This fact has led to various studies on its implications for learning and teaching. However, as with other technological resources, these implications will depend on how teachers use GenAI. Therefore, it is essential to identify teachers’ beliefs regarding the use of GenAI for teaching and learning. Methods: To this end, a questionnaire was designed and completed by 321 university teachers. This questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first included questions about the participants’ demographic information and a Likert scale on teachers’ pedagogical beliefs. The second part consisted of a 32-item Likert scale that evaluated teachers’ beliefs about the impact of GenAI on their students’ learning and their own teaching. These aspects were reflected through items that considered GenAI as either an educational opportunity or a threat. Results: The results showed that, of all the variables analyzed, only pedagogical beliefs and the frequency of previous GenAI use influenced beliefs about GenAI usage. Specifically, teachers with constructivist beliefs saw greater potential in GenAI compared to others. Similarly, teachers who regularly used these technologies had more positive beliefs about their educational use than those who used them sporadically or not at all. Lastly, it was also observed that while teachers valued the positive effects of GenAI on their teaching work, they also considered that its use could be detrimental to the learning processes of their students, making them more superficial. Discussion: These findings underline the importance of providing teachers with training focused on constructive approaches that enable them to maximize the potential of GenAI in education. In particular, it is crucial to promote teaching practices that, through student-centered GenAI use, foster active and reflective processes in students, aligned with the competencies demanded by today’s society.

AB  - This paper presents a strategy designed to evaluate AI-supplemented teaching and learning in a course belonging to a master program in Computer Science at the University of South-Eastern Norway. The strategy was closely related to the delivery format adopted in this program, where students take only one course at a time. Each course lasts for 6 weeks, comprising an initial 'reading week', an 'intensive lectures' week, a 3-week 'project assignment', and one 'assessment week'. The university supported the cost of OpenAI Plus account subscriptions offered to each student while the course was running, and specific activities were proposed to the class exploring the different ways in which AI tutoring could be used during each one of the 4 phases included in the course work plan. The strategy can be adapted to other program delivery formats by redistributing the proposed activities in accordance with the planned sequence of learning activities. It is also independent of which generative AI tool is selected, although OpenAI Plus accounts allow access to specific features that offer relevant pedagogical benefits, e.g., a simple process to create private language models that are easily customizable to each course subject.

AB  - Amalgamating generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), Bloom’s taxonomy and critical thinking present a promising avenue to revolutionize assessment pedagogy and foster higher-order cognitive skills needed for learning autonomy in the domain of self-directed learning. Gen AI, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a frontrunner in creative tasks, revolutionizing various domains such as art, music, writing and design and showcasing its ability to generate original content across various domains, including education. Incorporating social, cultural, economic and pedagogical dimensions, AI in education encompasses the incorporation of AI technologies like intelligent tutoring systems, chatbots, robots, learning analytics dashboards, adaptive learning systems and automated assessment to bolster and elevate the educational process. The significance of the impact on the creativity component of Krathwohl’s revised Bloom’s taxonomy arises from the utilization of Gen AI in creative tasks, which prompts concerns regarding the authenticity and originality of AI-generated content. This conceptual research study seeks to investigate the affordances of this amalgamation and aims to reframe the higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy to enhance critical thinking and self-directed learning among students. This study grounds the reader in the existing literature and sets a course for where research in this field should be heading, thus adding value, rather than only providing an overview of the literature. The overall aim of this research was to explore the affordances of the amalgamation of AI, Bloom’s taxonomy and critical thinking to support assessment pedagogy for self-directed learning. This paper identifies the gap in the current literature about reconceptualizing assessment pedagogy for developing higher-order thinking skills in a Gen AI higher education landscape. This paper presents a case of revisiting Bloom’s taxonomy, advocating the importance of AI fluency and assessment literacy for the development of critical thinking skills and self-directed learning.

AB  - Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant and popular form of NAI, presents a promising avenue for advancing personalized instruction via neurosymbolic educational agents. By leveraging structured knowledge, these agents can provide individualized learning experiences that align with specific learner preferences and desired learning paths, while also mitigating biases inherent in traditional AI systems. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of KGs, LLMs, and pedagogical agents – embodied characters designed to enhance learning – as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.

AB  - As the recent Large Language Models(LLM's) become increasingly competent in zero-shot and few-shot reasoning across various domains, educators are showing a growing interest in leveraging these LLM's in conversation-based tutoring systems. However, building a conversation-based personalized tutoring system poses considerable challenges in accurately assessing the student and strategically incorporating the assessment into teaching within the conversation. In this paper, we discuss design considerations for a personalized tutoring system that involves the following two key components: (1) a student modeling with diagnostic components, and (2) a conversation-based tutor utilizing LLM with prompt engineering that incorporates student assessment outcomes and various instructional strategies. Based on these design considerations, we created a proof-of-concept tutoring system focused on personalization and tested it with 20 participants. The results substantiate that our system's framework facilitates personalization, with particular emphasis on the elements constituting student modeling.

AB  - The lengthy monologue-style online lectures cause learners to lose engagement easily. Designing lectures in a “vicarious dialogue” format can foster learners' cognitive activities more than monologue-style. However, designing online lectures in a dialogue style catered to the diverse needs of learners is laborious for instructors. We conducted a design workshop with eight educational experts and seven instructors to present key guidelines and the potential use of large language models (LLM) to transform a monologue lecture script into pedagogically meaningful dialogue. Applying these design guidelines, we created VIVID which allows instructors to collaborate with LLMs to design, evaluate, and modify pedagogical dialogues. In a within-subjects study with instructors (N=12), we show that VIVID helped instructors select and revise dialogues efficiently, thereby supporting the authoring of quality dialogues. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to assist instructors with creating high-quality educational dialogues across various learning stages.

AB  - The History of Design course is a foundational component for art and design students; however, many students perceive it as abstract and unengaging, mainly due to its highly conceptual nature and traditional lecture-based teaching methods. To address these challenges, this study investigates the impact of AI-generated virtual instructors and a conversational teaching style on academic achievement, cognitive load, and student engagement in the flipped classroom. This study employed a 2 × 2 experimental design, with 124 first-year design students randomly assigned to four experimental conditions: human-formal (HF), human-conversational (HC), AI-generated-formal (AF), and AI-generated-conversational (AC). The results indicate that the AI-generated virtual instructor significantly enhances affective engagement and has a comparably beneficial effect on academic performance and cognitive load compared to the human instructor. Furthermore, the conversational teaching style considerably improves students’ academic performance, reduces cognitive load, and fosters engagement. These findings suggest that integrating generative AI tools with conversational teaching style within a flipped classroom model not only optimizes students’ learning experiences but also offers a practical framework for reducing educators’ workloads while contributing valuable insights into the application of generative AI in education.

AB  - This article outlines what a successful artificial intelligence digital humanities (AI DH) curriculum entails and why it is so critical now. Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping our world and is poised to exacerbate long-standing crises including (1) the crisis of higher education and the humanities, (2) the lack of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in computer science and technology fields and (3) the wider social and economic crises facilitated by new technologies. We outline a number of ways in which an AI DH curriculum offers concrete and impactful responses to these many crises. AI DH yields meaningful new avenues of research for the humanities and the humanistic social sciences, and offers new ways that higher education can better prepare students for the world into which they graduate. DEI metrics show how an AI DH curriculum can engage students traditionally underserved by conventional STEM courses. Finally, AI DH educates all students for civic engagement in order to address both the social and economic impacts of emerging AI technologies. This article provides an overview of an AI DH curriculum, the motivating theory behind design decisions, and a detailed look into two sample courses.

AB  - Introduction: the article is dedicated to studying the main capabilities and effectiveness of using AI in the modern education system and the impact of neural networks on developing analytical skills in learners. Method: the research is based on the comprehensive application of analysis, comparative methods, forecasting and data analysis, pedagogical observation, and generalisation methods. Results: the article establishes that AI began actively integrating into the education system in November 2022 with access to the ChatGPT service. It also identifies that the use of artificial intelligence in the education system at various levels is founded on the integration of three primary skills: learning (collection and analysis of information), thinking (analytics, choosing optimal action algorithms), and self-correction (improving setting algorithms to achieve more accurate results). It is established that there are two main directions for using AI to enhance the efficiency of the educational process: the application of generative AI (generating texts, plans, annotations, presentations, images) and predictive AI (automation of educational processes). The use of AI in the education system occurs in three main areas: implementing personalised learning, automating essential educational functions (checking tests, problems, equations, even evaluating creative works), and improving the process of distance education and self-education. Conclusions: it is determined that the main disadvantage of using AI in education is the reduction in the level of socialisation and critical thinking among learners. Therefore, it is crucial to balance using neural networks in the learning process and the presence of the teacher’s personality in this process.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd), such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and chatbots, has been used to assist teaching, learning, pedagogical innovations, educational data mining, and learning analytics. To explore the overall effects of AI in the classroom on students’ learning achievement, the final analysis included 21 empirical studies (extracting 23 effect sizes) using experimental or quasi-experiments from 2012 to 2021, incorporating 4996 students. As can be seen, AI has a small to medium significant positive overall mean effect size (FEM g = 0.326; REM g = 0.515) of the use of AI with respect to students’ learning achievement. In addition, the overall mean effect size was significantly affected by educational stage; and discipline. However, the technology type does not have a significant impact on learning achievement.

A total of 15 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified that examined the impact of GenAI on second-language proficiency, motivation, and self-regulation. GenAI was shown to have significant effects on English proficiency and self-regulation, demonstrating its versatility in enhancing language learning outcomes. However, GenAI failed to show significant effects on learning motivation, and based on this finding we highlight the need to develop measures of motivation that are suitable for GenAI in education. Possible ways to apply GenAI in the informal language learning environment are also discussed based on the included literature.

AB  - This study surveyed 445 primary, secondary, and higher education teachers to understand their usage of AI tools in the classroom. Results revealed that while teachers generally have a positive attitude toward AI in education, only 25% of them have actually incorporated AI-based tools into their teaching. Moreover, the most common used tools were ChatGPT, Dall-E, and Midjourney. Finally, primary and secondary school teachers mainly use AI for content creation purposes such as presentations, texts, or videos, without emphasizing student engagement with AI tools. In contrast, higher education teachers utilize AI for academic-technical purposes, explaining AI functioning, obtaining information, and enabling students to experiment with AI tools, as well as research-related tasks like text translation, or data analysis. Based on these results, AI training programs for educators should be tailored to each stage, incorporating a wider variety of AI tools beyond the commonly used ones like ChatGPT.

AB  - The rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into educational settings prompts an urgent examination of its efficacy and the strategies that students employ to harness its potential. This study focuses on preservice chemistry teachers use of generative AI for chemistry-specific problem-solving and task completion. We found that there is a prevalent reliance on copy-pasting tactics in initial prompting approaches, and students need guidance to improve their prompting abilities. By implementing the “Five S” prompting framework, we explore the evolution of student prompts and the resultant satisfaction with AI-generated responses. Our findings indicate that, while students initially struggle with the nuances of effective prompting, the adoption of structured frameworks significantly enhances their perceived quality of AI-generated answers. This research sheds light on the current state of AI use among students but also underscores the importance of targeted educational frameworks to refine AI interaction in academic contexts. In particular, we suggest critical engagement and methodological prompt engineering strategies to maximize the educational benefits of generative AI technologies.

AB  - In contemporary society, Artificial Intelligence (AI) pervades numerous facets of our lives and is likely to impact many sectors and professions, including education. Tertiary-level students in particular face challenges regarding the use of AI for studies and assessment, including limited understanding of AI tools, as well as a lack of deep critical engagement with AI for learning (Shibani et al., 2024). To respond to emerging developments in generative AI, the recent Australian Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) report suggests tertiary-level learning and assessments be designed to foster responsible and ethical use of AI (Lodge et al., 2023). This involves the development of AI literacy among students to engage with AI in critical, ethical ways that aid their learning and not hinder it. Our project aims to narrow the AI literacy gap among students from diverse study backgrounds by providing foundational knowledge and developing critical skills for practical use of AI tools for learning and professional practice, in collaboration with students and academics as part of a Students as Partners (SAP) initiative. Staff bring expertise in AI critical engagement and students bring practical, first-hand experiences of learning in this collaboration, supported by the university’s SAP program. Building on the current UNESCO recommendations for the use of generative AI in education (UNESCO, 2023) and prior theoretical frameworks on AI literacy (Chiu et al., 2024; Ng, et al., 2021; Southworth et al., 2023) we target key skills that higher education students should develop to meaningfully engage with AI. By creating accessible and engaging resources, such as instructional videos and comprehensive guides on generative AI applications like ChatGPT and ways to prompt for enhancing learning, we introduce existing AI tools and teach students to use them effectively, promoting a hands-on learning environment. Using learning design principles, the developed curriculum will be presented in an AI Literacy module on a Canvas site, with supporting instruction workshopped with student participants for evaluation. Student cohorts recruited from diverse disciplines will pilot and assess the effectiveness of the program, and qualitative methods such as focus groups and interviews will be used for evaluation of our intervention and continuous improvements. Findings will inform tertiary students’ current level of AI literacy and the effectiveness of interventions to improve key skills beyond their disciplinary knowledge, better preparing them for life beyond university. Indeed, the implementation of similar AI literacy courses has demonstrated statistically significant improvements in AI literacy and understanding of AI concepts amongst university students (Kong, Cheung, &amp; Zhang, 2021). Our approach underscores the importance of relational engagement in higher education with students as partners (Matthews, 2018) and participatory design with students in a topic that is significant in the current age of AI (Laupichler et al., 2022). The course's flexibility to be accessed directly or embedded into other curricula ensures scalability and broader impact, solidifying the validity of our multifaceted approach. Through utilising relevant research methodologies and learning design principles, we endeavour to create an AI literacy course that is robust, accessible, educational, and engaging to use by tertiary-level students from diverse study backgrounds.

AB  - Indonesia has so many local cultures and languages that spread from Sabang to Merauke, and most Indonesians do not know how to speak two or more regional languages in Indonesia. Most Indonesians only know familiar tribes that are only commonly heard. Because of this problem, governments in the Indonesian provinces have included lessons on Indonesian culture. The lesson will explain Indonesia's national and local culture for their area. In this way, the government can also help Indonesians learn more about their local language. This paper proposes a solution to create a learning portal website for users, both from Indonesia and other countries, to learn Indonesian culture and regional languages. In this way, the author hopes that users can learn about Indonesian local culture and language and contribute to preserving Indonesian local culture and language. This application was built on a web-based basis by applying the following HTML, CSS, and javascript using Personal Home Pages (PHP) for database connection using MySQL. The built application was designed using a use case diagram and class diagram to describe the database relations.

AB  - The increasing significance of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries highlights the necessity for industry leaders and professionals to comprehend and gain knowledge about AI. The urgency for AI literacy is more critical than ever due to the potential unethical use of AI resulting from insufficient knowledge. This issue is particularly crucial for educators because they need to understand and adapt to the impact of AI within educational institutions, with some needing to use and become literate in AI, given that students now have increased access to public AI tools. This research presents a multi-phase study to address the issue of bridging the knowledge gap in AI by conducting co-creation with innovation champions, illustrated by a case of Generative AI innovation in a K-12 school. Using action design research, we engaged experienced teachers who are experts in pedagogical innovation to co-create a generative AI-enhanced platform at a leading K-12 education institution known for its pedagogical innovation in Australia. The findings reveal that champions enhance their knowledge through their subject-matter expertise, organizational knowledge, and AI knowledge gained through external exposure and experience. The study also highlights the key elements that facilitate a cross-domain knowledge exchange platform, enabling champions to be exposed to and experience AI technological learning, leading to shifts in their understanding and perception of AI. The initially unaware and sceptical champions become more aware and capable of articulating more technical AI knowledge rooted in a shared value. This research demonstrates how co-creation serves as a pathway for learning AI, particularly among K-12 teachers who are innovation champions. It underscores the impact of experiential and organizational learning on AI collaborative learning and behavioral intentions. Additionally, the study presents that aligning organizational and personal visions and values can influence perceptions about AI technologies, enhancing the discourse on AI and education innovation.

AB  - In the realm of digital education, the growing use of short-form online videos, coupled with innovative generative AI methods, has dramatically expanded the production of didactic academic videos. This shift, however, underscores a critical question - how to ascertain the "effectiveness" of these videos for student learning? It is essential to devise a classification mechanism that filters videos for clarity, comprehensibility, and their capacity to meet student learning objectives. The automated evaluation of these learning videos holds substantial implications for student academic performance. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel supervised-learning-based approach, predicated on video feature analysis, to predict the effectiveness of K-12 science and mathematics videos. Our method integrates diverse features such as image, spoken text, and audio, among other hand-crafted elements, to accurately assess video effectiveness. We conduct an evaluation of our approach using a comprehensive dataset comprised of 3,134 short-form academic videos. The results demonstrate robust performance, with the system achieving an accuracy of 76.1% and an F1 score of 80.6%.

AB  - This paper discusses how effective ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is likely to be compared to traditional corrective recasts in teaching English grammar to engineering undergraduates. With the rise of digital communication, a generation of learners for whom traditional methods seem to be less effective has emerged. This research contrasts the effects of ChatGPT's corrective feedback versus conventional teacher-led corrective recasts on grammatical proficiency among students, especially in subject-verb agreement and accuracy in tenses. 90 engineering students were divided into two groups one with the traditional approach to instruction and another using ChatGPT to practice grammar. Pre- and post-assessment tests were administered to the participants to measure improvements in grammar proficiency. Statistical analysis, using paired t-tests, indicated that both groups improved significantly, with the ChatGPT-assisted group showing more improvement in proficiency compared to the traditional approach. Another independent sample t-test confirmed that the AI-led feedback group had a significantly larger mean improvement in grammar proficiency compared to the traditional instruction group. The results of this study demonstrate that ChatGPT provides more effective corrective feedback to engineering students with varying levels of proficiency in subject-verb agreement and tenses usage, suggesting potential benefits for language education through integration with AI.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has gained great attention recently. Integration of AI tools in anatomy teaching is currently engaging researchers and academics worldwide. Several AI chatbots have been generated, the most popular being ChatGPT (OpenAI: San Francisco, California, USA). Since its first public release in November 2022, several research papers have pointed to its potential role in anatomy education. However, it is not yet known whether it will prove superior to other available AI tools in this role. This article sheds some light on the current status of research concerning AI applications in anatomy education and compares the performances of three well-known chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) in answering anatomy questions. A total of 23 questions were used as prompts for each chatbot. These questions comprised 10 knowledge-based, 10 analysis-based USMLE Step 1-type, and three radiographs. ChatGPT was the most accurate of the three, scoring 100% accuracy. However, in terms of comprehensiveness, Claude was the best; it gave very organized anatomical responses. Gemini performed less well than the other two, with a scored accuracy of 60% and less scientific explanations. On the basis of these findings, this study recommends the incorporation of Claude and ChatGPT in anatomy education, but not Gemini, at least in its current state.

We introduce exponentially many valid inequalities to the Chopra-Rao formulation, which we call generalized arc inequalities (GAI), and develop a linear time algorithm to separate the most violated generalized arc inequality. We show that the polynomial size extended graph formulation is equivalent to the Chopra-Rao formulation augmented by the exponentially many GAI.

AB  - Since its debut in the field of education nearly three decades ago, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been considered a powerful tool to facilitate new paradigms for instructional design and innovative educational practice by means of intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive learning systems, educational chatbots, teaching robots, to name a few. Recent technological advances in the adjacent areas of natural language processing, machine learning, and computer graphics focusing primarily on design features that can improve their human-like qualities of naturalness and believability as human interlocutors have also amplified new application opportunities for Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) or Animated Pedagogical Agents (APAs) within the area of Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL). Although AI-powered IVAs hold the potential to improve the learning process in nearly any knowledge domain and personalize automation in teaching by embodying different roles in the learning environment, strikingly few studies have empirically attempted to assess IVAs impact on L2 learners’ academic achievement when learning English as a Foreign (EFL) so far. The present article addresses this issue via a systematic review of relevant interventionist IVA studies that were conducted in EFL settings and published within the 2015–2020 timeframe examining IVAs key affordances, major barriers in their adoption for language learning purposes, and the CALL research trends currently prevalent on the topic. Pedagogical implications for the effective implementation of IVA technology in L2 contexts are discussed and future research avenues in the area are highlighted

AB  - AI-generated virtual instructors powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment online learning by making it more interactive and personalized. In this work, we focus specifically on applying this technology to financial literacy education, a critical life skill that is unfortunately undertaught in most school systems. To investigate this potential, we developed three conditions for delivering financial education: A) a Passive Virtual Instructor, B) an Interactive Virtual Instructor powered by LLMs to enable two-way conversation with the learner, and C) a Personally Selected Interactive Virtual Instructor, allowing learners to choose their preferred AI instructor. In a study with 90 participants aged 18–25, we found that incorporating interactivity significantly improved learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and humanness compared to the passive agent. The ability to personally select an instructor provided little additional benefit for most measures. These results highlight the potential of interactive virtual instructors for enhancing motivational and experiential factors, even if comprehension itself is unaffected.

AB  - Programming is a creative activity, but it can be difficult to learn due to constant updates, poorly maintained documentation, and unexpected errors. One reason for the difficulties is the shortage of programming teachers, which often leaves students unable to get help when they need it, even for simple questions. Many unanswered questions are a barrier to improving programming skills for creative purposes. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue by exploring whether an AI-based system can help reduce the difficulties faced by students. Recent advancements in deep learning technology have made it easier for teachers to train AI models that can learn from their own experiences in the classroom, including the types of questions, requests, and difficulties that students encounter. We have developed an AI model that can translate Python code from Japanese by using machine translation techniques and large language models. We have integrated this model into a learning assistant system that suggests code to students when they express their programming intentions. In this paper, we present our experiences in developing and deploying this AI-based assistant in the classroom, as well as the feedback we have received from students. By sharing our initial experiences, we aim to envision the potential of educational AI development for the future.

AB  - As blended learning moved toward a new phase during the COVID-19 pandemic, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology provided opportunities to develop more diverse and dynamic blended learning. This systematic review focused on publications related to the use of AI applications in blended learning. The original studies from January 2007 to October 2023 were extracted from the Google Scholar, ERIC, and Web of Science databases. Finally, 30 empirical studies under the inclusion criteria were reviewed based on two conceptual frameworks: four key challenges of blended learning and three roles of AI. We found that AI applications have been used mainly for the online asynchronous individual learning component in blended learning; little work has been conducted on AI applications that help connect online activities with classroom-based offline activities. Many studies have identified the role of AI as a direct mediator to help control flexibility and autonomy of students in blended learning. However, abundant studies have also identified AI as a supplementary assistant using advanced learning analytics technologies that promote effective interactions with students and facilitate the learning process. Finally, the fewest number of studies have explored the role of AI as a new subject such as use as pedagogical agents or robots. Considering the advancements of generative AI technologies, we expect more research on AI in blended learning. The findings of this study suggested that future studies should guide teachers and their smart AI partner to implement blended learning more effectively.

AB  - With the growing attention to generative artificial intelligence tools, particularly ChatGPT, there have been efforts to explore its implications for and applications in teacher education programs. Mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) can leverage ChatGPT as a facilitative tool to enhance preservice teachers' understanding, analyzing, and enacting of high-leverage, effective mathematics teaching practices. One such practice is designing mathematical tasks. In this study, we, three MTEs, utilized a self-study methodology to first highlight how our domains of knowledge informed our prompt engineering techniques given to ChatGPT to generate mathematical tasks and second, to share lessons learned from our interactions with ChatGPT during our critical friend dialogues. We primarily used our pedagogical and pedagogical content knowledge to craft prompts. Our prompt engineering techniques involved revising, generating, or editing. The lessons learned underlined the different conceptualizations of what constitutes a task, and the importance of articulating and navigating the learning goal throughout ChatGPT interactions. Our findings have implications for fostering MTEs' knowledge of using ChatGPT to generate mathematical tasks and ways of supporting current and future teachers in using ChatGPT in their classrooms.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4 for training tourist guides. The study followed a systematic approach by conducting assessments on undergraduate students from three institutions who are enrolled in tourist guide education programs and both ChatGPT versions. Competent academicians assessed a succession of questions in the form of open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The mean scores obtained on the multiple-choice test for ChatGPT-4 were better than those of both ChatGPT-3.5 and college students, thereby indicating that ChatGPT-4 has greatly improved. Nevertheless, when responding to open-ended queries, individuals with real-life experience as tour guides gave much more inclusive as well as convincing answers compared to ChatGPT-4. This underscores the importance of hands-on experiences in training tour guides, where AI technology is currently weak. This study contributes to better comprehension regarding the role played by artificial intelligence (AI) in education with reference to the tourism industry specifically. While at the same time emphasizing how critical human expertise is needed during practical learning sessions, this implies that AI has potential for disseminating theoretical knowledge. The results suggest that AI is a beneficial supplementary aid in educational environments, rather than a replacement for human-centered instructional approaches.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in education has the potential to revolutionize learning by addressing significant challenges and accelerating progress. Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated the ability to produce high-quality text and other content, potentially transforming academic tasks like essay writing. Despite these advantages, educators are concerned about the ethical implications of AI use. Risks such as misinformation, academic dishonesty, and overreliance on AI must be thoroughly assessed. This discourse analysis explored the perceptions of teachers on AI use in academic settings, highlighting concepts leading to ethical issues involved in its use. Convenience sampling (n = 30) was used to select the participants for a one-on-one interview. Findings indicated that overreliance, dishonesty, cheating, are plagiarism were some ethical issues that emerged from the discourse. Convenience, driven by ease and accessibility, can lead students to excessively use AI, which may inadvertently hamper their learning processes. Overreliance, fueled by trust in generated outputs, can result in students depending heavily on AI-generated information, which may not always be accurate or critically analyzed. Students who feel incapable of producing quality work on their own may resort to AI, believing they lack the necessary skills. This reliance on AI can erode their confidence and critical thinking abilities, further entrenching their dependence on technology. While AI can enhance learning and efficiency, it also poses risks of academic dishonesty, overreliance, and diminished student engagement with the learning process. Teachers perceive AI use as unethical, primarily due to how students interact with and depend on AI, ultimately affecting their academic integrity and genuine intellectual development.

AB  - Identifying and addressing areas of weakness of online learning students early on is critically important to preventminor issues from becoming major obstacles to their success. It is desirable to have a tool that allows learners to conduct personalized formative assessment on demand anytime during their course study. To minimize the cognitive load of a learner and facilitate the iterative learning process, a pedagogical strategy is to identify a singular weak skill each formative assessment and to provide adaptive feedback for remediation for the learner to close the gap between his/her current performance and the expected mastery criteria. As one gap closes, another gap may be identified afterward, renewing the formative assessment and feedback loop. For such singular weakness identification, minimizing the time spent or the number of questions on each assessment is crucial for maintaining learner engagement. On the other hand, it is also critical to ensure that the result of the assessment is reliable to provide effective feedback. To balance the accuracy and efficiency of the assessment, we propose three algorithms for fast and adaptive weakness identification based on the good arm identification (GAI) problem in multi-armed bandit-based machine learning. We evaluate the sensitivity and performance of the proposed algorithms through simulation.

AB  - The Archival / Preservation Education SIG session offers pedagogical insights on master’s-level information science and archival education. Five ten-minute individual presentations and audience discussion elucidate educators’ roles in developing competent new professionals; presenters bring perspectives from multiple states. “Curricular Integration of Audiovisual Archiving and Preservation” by Sarah Buchanan explores connections between coursework and professional experiences completed by MLIS graduate students. Students actively contribute to curriculum maintenance through their digitization and documentation activities, metadata creation, and perhaps most significantly community-based dialogues around project progressions and expert input – collectively ensuring the preparedness of today’s archivists to address technical challenges. “Operationalizing the Value of Legacy Research Data” by Gretchen Stahlman and Inna Kouper explores the need for a more systematic understanding of legacy research data efforts and the value of legacy data as perceived by various research, library, and data communities. To illuminate relevant considerations, two legacy data preservation case study sites are analyzed, further situating the socio-technical processes and impact of working with and curating legacy data, as well as the role of equity, fairness, and justice. “The Need for Archival Triage” by Jeff Hirschy and Jessica Herr demonstrates how new archivists and educators could benefit from expanded mental models of archival workplace realities. The presentation emphasizes the values of flexibility and adaptability on the part of new archivists and educators, as they strengthen tenuous connections between “perfect” archival theory (in settings with full funding and full staff), professional problem-solving, continuing education, and the definitions of preservation and oral history. “Bridging Gaps between Archival Studies and Social Justice Scholarship: Training of Community-Embedded Paraprofessional Archivists Who Are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color” by Bharat Mehra, Robert Riter, and Ron Harris highlights ongoing experiences in bridging gaps between archival studies and social justice scholarship via curricular development/implementation, strategic collaborations, and project design in the IMLS-funded “Archival Studies Social Justice Master’s Scholarship Program (SJ4A).” SJ4A addresses current gaps in diversifying the workforce and operationalizing the how-to’s of social justice in archival practice while proposing systematic, intentional, action-oriented, community-engaged, and impact-driven education. “AI and the Future of Archival/Preservation Education” by Suliman Hawamdeh and Manar Alsaid discusses the types of training, competencies and practices which need to be integrated into archival and preservation education to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and yet protect the authenticity and originality of archival material. Generative AI natural language tools and chatbots such as ChatGPT have the potential to enhance archival education and research by identifying sources, gathering and processing large amount of historical material / data in a timely manner, and assisting with methodological problems and computational tasks. The recent issues concerning document classification of presidential records and gaps in the National Archives’ tracking of information highlight the magnitude of spaces where AI could be the sword with two sharp edges. The moderator will facilitate Q&amp;A within and across the presentations.

AB  - The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education and the workforce necessitates that students acquire critical competencies, including digital literacy, data integrity, and ethical AI use, to navigate an increasingly AI-driven world. Equally, academic staff must be upskilled to effectively guide students in the ethical and practical applications of AI. This project examines how a private higher education (HE) institute has modified its Quality Assessment Framework (QAF) to incorporate an AI competence dimension, improve HE assessment and foster students’ competencies. This new dimension complements the existing QAF elements—Intellectual Quality, Significance, and Student Support to ensure a holistic approach in preparing students for AI-integrated academic and professional environments. This project’s framework and innovative tools, such as the enhanced QAF and an AI-driven Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) assessment review tool, support educators in adapting curriculum and assessment design, and empower them to integrate AI competencies seamlessly into the curriculum. The development of these tools drew upon established frameworks, particularly the QAF (Gore et al., 2009) and the AI Assessment Scale (AIAS) by Perkins et al. (2024), which categorises AI usage across five levels, guides assessment reviews and ensures consistent standards for AI integration in student work. A trial, conducted across selected disciplines at the institute, involved academic staff as assessment reviewers and utilised the GPT tool to streamline the assessment review process by aiding in feedback provision, coding, and suggestions for improvement. Evaluation of the tool includes qualitative and quantitative methodologies, gathering academic feedback on usability, clarity, and effectiveness, as well as comparative studies to assess review time and quality before and after GPT integration. Usability testing evaluates workflow compatibility, while academic performance data provide insights into the tool’s impact on student outcomes. Initial results on the tool’s success in enhancing assessment alignment with institutional goals and fostering a comprehensive understanding of AI competence were also examined. Developing and implementing these tools has presented challenges, including the complexity of aligning them with diverse curriculum needs across disciplines, the time investment required for staff training, and the necessity of continuous updates to keep pace with AI technology. Addressing these challenges has been crucial to ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of these solutions. This digital poster provides insights into the project, covering its development process, trial outcomes, challenges encountered, and future directions for integrating AI competence in higher education assessments.

AB  - This study investigates the integration of AI tools, ChatGPT 3.5 and Bard (now Gemini), in the education of civil engineering students specializing in pavement design. Two groups, totaling sixty-eight undergraduate students (Group A= 28, Group B=40), enrolled in the Pavement Design course at UTPL from October 2023 to February 2024, participated. They were tasked with generating prompts covering various pavement design topics. These included Traffic, Subgrade Characteristics, Asphalt Materials, AASHTO-Flexible Design, AASHTO-Rigid Design, Interlocking Concrete Pavements Design, International Roughness Index (IRI), and Construction Systems on Pavements. Students then assessed AI-generated responses using a predefined grading scale. The results revealed Bard achieved a higher approval rate of 71.1% compared to ChatGPT's 48.5%. ChatGPT 3.5 would not meet the passing threshold for certain topics, such as AASHTO-Flexible Design, AASHTO-Rigid Design, and IRI. In contrast, Bard consistently achieved higher approval rates across all assessed topics. Students acknowledged the AI tools' significant contribution to a deeper understanding of the course material. This integration positively influenced civil engineering students' learning outcomes, highlighting the evolving role of AI in education and encouraging further exploration in academia.

AB  - Automation of students’ program code verification is an important task, as it provides an opportunity to provide prompt and effective feedback to the student, significantly reducing resource costs for checking solutions. In connection with the rapid development of AI systems, new opportunities and approaches to automation appear. We consider a fundamentally new approach for the estimation of the time complexity of an algorithm. AI-based approaches compared to traditional systems that use simulations. The process of determining the complexity of the algorithm using AI-based approaches takes much less time. The study used AI systems to estimate the complexity of the algorithm based on code fragments. According to the results obtained, a decision is made regarding the suitability of these systems for automating the evaluation of students’ program codes. We also offer for consideration the methods of implementing such approaches to the automation of checking student assignments in IT-related subjects based on AI systems. To assess the time complexity of code fragments, we used ChatGPT, Bard, TimeComplexity.ai, Chatsonic. All AI systems which participated in the experiment accurately determined the algorithmic complexity for each of the code fragments written in Python. The results indicate that ChatGPT and Google Bard demonstrated satisfactory accuracy in assessing the time complexity of code fragments written in Java. We developed an API that allows to partial automate teacher’s work during checks of students’ assignments. Further research will relate to integration of developed API into existing educational platforms and frameworks. Another area of future research is the issues of automated code quality determination and plagiarism checking.

AB  - With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the mainstream and the impending need for an AI-trained workforce, we must devise strategies to lower the entry barrier to AI education. Advanced mathematical preparation and computational thinking skills are two major barriers in imparting a rigorous AI course at the high school level. Consequently, many existing AI-focused educational programs for high school students are basic primers and lack technical depth. In this paper, we assess two pedagogical instruments for increasing the self-efficacy of students in learning neural networks at the high school level. The first research question is whether high school students learn the basics of neural network design through scaffolded AI research projects. We also explore whether a dual advising structure with a research mentor and a communication teaching assistant enhances student's self-efficacy in computing. For both of these questions, we define key variables to quantify student mastery and their computational thinking using qualitative student feedback and student reflection using GPT-3. We provide a reproducible blueprint for using large language models in this task to assess student learning in other contexts as well. We also correlate our results with a pre- and post-course Likert survey to find significant factors that affect student self-efficacy and belonging in AI. With our course design and dual advising mentoring model, we find that students showed a significant improvement in their ability to articulate technical aspects within the AI domain and an increase in their confidence in speaking up in the AI field. Two out of the ten research projects applied AI techniques beyond classroom teachings, yielding original research contributions, and another six showcased students' capabilities in building neural networks from scratch. Our study has a strong selection bias since it focuses on top-performing students. However, the exploration of the two pedagogical instruments (scaffolding research projects and dual advising structure) aimed at high school students provides promising insights for future AI curricula design at the high school level.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within educational frameworks, particularly in disciplines such as web design and development, represents a significant evolution in pedagogical strategies. This article examines a unique educational setup where students, while engaging in a web design class, utilize AI tools for text, image, and code creation within a simulated real-world scenario involving a client—dubbed "Chef Cookie Cutter". This simulated client interaction introduces unpredictability through mid-assignment requirement changes, thereby mimicking the dynamic nature of real-world web development projects. The focus of this case study is the critical role of human-in-the-loop (HITL) engagement in AI-assisted assignments, where students' adaptability, creativity, and problem-solving skills are put to the test. Such engagement not only prepares students for the intricacies and challenges of their future professions but also emphasizes the importance of human oversight in AI-driven processes. By incorporating generative AI, video avatars, and personalized learning mechanisms, this educational approach fosters a rich, interactive learning environment that enhances digital pedagogy. The findings suggest that integrating HITL in AI assignments significantly improves learning outcomes by fostering an adaptive learning environment that closely mirrors the complexities and demands of the industry, thereby preparing students more effectively for their future careers.

AB  - This systematic review provides unique findings with an up-to-date examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the US to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72%. Similar to the findings of other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the AIEd was intended for 72% of the studies focused on students, 17% instructors, and 11% managers. In answering the overarching question of how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools, such as Chat GPT.

AB  - Despite a number of excellent queer labor histories, the historiography of lesbian, gay, and trans people and the historiography of work and workers have remained relatively uninfluenced by each other. This is puzzling in some obvious ways: the Mattachine Society was founded by a communist, and class questions were right there at the origin of the field of queer history with John D'Emilio, Leslie Feinberg, Joanne Meyerowitz, and George Chauncey. D'Emilio and Feinberg were Marxists and Meyerowitz began as a labor historian, while Chauncey had the legendary historian of work David Montgomery for one of his advisors. Enumerating his graduate cohort in the acknowledgments of Gay New York , Chauncey names a string of Montgomery's advisees, now eminent labor historians, followed on the next page by Edward and Dorothy Thompson, with whom Chauncey spent a postdoctoral year at Rutgers. More substantively, a central analytic move of Gay New York , itself building on and developing D'Emilio's classic intervention, is to understand the urban gay world in much the same way that, say, Herbert Gutman understood the worlds of working-class immigrants (with which gay social worlds overlapped to a great degree): as a “counterpublic,” although Gutman would not have used the term.

Researchers who have found the revolutionary potential and essential contributions of AI in boosting educational practices and approaches have extensively emphasized this trend. (George & Wooden, 2023; George & Paul, 2020). The higher education domain is progressively acknowledging AI as a key factor for competitive edge (Hannan & Liu, 2021). This paper aims to examine the existing research on AI implications in the higher education segment. Grounded on the theory of technology diffusion (Rogers, 2003), our research systematically examines the scientific field, identifying emerging research topics. Using SCOPUS as a database for peer-reviewed article selection (publication period 2011–2024) and bibliometric analysis, we provide an insight into the varied geographic spread of research within the realm of AI in education. Our findings shed light on the evolution of models for the adoption of AI technologies in higher education, revealing six main areas of research in the field: (1) teaching and involving students in the educational process using generative AI, (2) using chatbots to improve the educational process, (3) improving the literacy of teachers and students in the field of AI, (4) AI and blockchain in educational practices (5) development of regulations for the use of AI and (6) improving operational processes at universities. This article explains current influences on research prospects in the context of higher education. By offering an understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by AI, this paper encourages educators to investigate possible uses of AI in the context of higher education.

AB  - Mastering mathematics is often challenging for many students; however, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) offers numerous advantages, including enhanced data analysis, automated feedback, and the potential for creating more interactive and engaging learning environments. Despite these benefits, there is a need for comprehensive reviews that provide an overview of AI's role in mathematics education to help educators identify the best AI tools, and to inform researchers about current trends and future directions. This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) to investigate the applications and trends of AI in mathematics education by examining articles published in reputable journals indexed in Web of Science and Scopus. The review categorizes AI tools into those narrowly addressing mathematical problems, such as solving equations and visualizing geometry, and those offering broader pedagogical support, including adaptive learning systems and generative AI platforms. Key aspects analyzed include the distribution of AI in Mathematics Education (AIME) studies across different educational levels, the types and categories of AI tools used, the functionality of commercialized AIME tools available on the internet, and the emerging trends and future directions in AIME based on recent literature. The insights from this SLR are crucial for educators, policymakers, and researchers, enabling them to integrate AI effectively into mathematics education and tailor tools to specific teaching strategies and learning needs.

AB  - With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education, AI-Agents have shown tremendous potential in collaborative learning. However, traditional Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) methods still have limitations in addressing the unique demands of programming education. This study proposes an innovative AI-Agent-supported Collaborative Learning (AI-CL) approach, aimed at enhancing students' programming learning experience and effectiveness through intelligent assistance from AI-Agents. The research developed an AI-Agent system based on large language models and employed a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of the AI-CL method on students' learning achievement, self-efficacy, cognitive load, and learning interest. The experiment was conducted at a university in Shanghai, recruiting 45 undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to the AI-CL experimental group (n = 24) and the CSCL control group (n = 21). The experimental context was set in an ACM programming competition teaching environment, lasting for 6 weeks with 70-min sessions each week. Results showed that the AI-CL group significantly outperformed the CSCL group in learning achievement, self-efficacy, and learning interest. Regarding cognitive load, the AI-CL group demonstrated significantly lower mental effort compared to the CSCL group, while there was no significant difference in mental load. These findings not only provide new theoretical perspectives for the application of cognitive load theory and self-efficacy theory in AI-assisted learning environments but also offer strong practical guidance for higher education institutions to introduce AI-Agent-assisted collaborative learning models in programming courses.

AB  - Reading, understanding and explaining code have traditionally been important skills for novices learning programming. As large language models (LLMs) become prevalent, these foundational skills are more important than ever given the increasing need to understand and evaluate model-generated code. Brand new skills are also needed, such as the ability to formulate clear prompts that can elicit intended code from an LLM. Thus, there is great interest in integrating pedagogical approaches for the development of both traditional coding competencies and the novel skills required to interact with LLMs. One effective way to develop and assess code comprehension ability is with "Explain in plain English'' (EiPE) questions, where students succinctly explain the purpose of a fragment of code. However, grading EiPE questions has always been difficult given the subjective nature of evaluating written explanations and this has stifled their uptake. In this paper, we explore a natural synergy between EiPE questions and code-generating LLMs to overcome this limitation. We propose using an LLM to generate code based on students' responses to EiPE questions - not only enabling EiPE responses to be assessed automatically, but helping students develop essential code comprehension and prompt crafting skills in parallel. We investigate this idea in an introductory programming course and report student success in creating effective prompts for solving EiPE questions. We also examine student perceptions of this activity and how it influences their views on the use of LLMs for aiding and assessing learning.

AB  - Background: Despite global interest in the interface of Algorithmically-driven writing tools (ADWTs) and academic integrity, empirical data considering educators' perspectives on the challenges, benefits, and policies of ADWTs use remain scarce. Aim: This study responds to calls for empirical investigation concerning the affordances and encumbrances of ADWTs, and their implications for academic integrity. Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey research design, we recruited through snowball sampling 100 graduate students and faculty members representing ten disciplines. Participants completed an online survey on perceptions, practices, and policies in the utilization of ADWTs in education. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) helped us understand the factors influencing the acceptance and use of ADWTs. Results: The study found that teacher respondents highly value the diverse ways ADWTs can support their educational goals (perceived usefulness). However, they must overcome their barrier threshold such as limited access to these tools (perception of external control), a perceived lack of knowledge on their use (computer self-efficacy), and concerns about ADWTs' impact on academic integrity, creativity, and more (output quality). Conclusion: AI technologies are making headway in more educational institutions because of their proven and potential benefits for teaching, learning, assessment, and research. However, AI in education, particularly ADWTs, demands critical awareness of ethical protocols and entails collaboration and empowerment of all stakeholders by introducing innovations that showcase human intelligence over AI or partnership with AI.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven learning has become an irreversible trend in foreign language education. Scholars are increasingly focusing on this field, yet few have examined its impact within English literature classes. To fill this gap, we designed an 8-week intervention study with mixed methods and recruited 90 students, with 42 in the experimental group and 48 in the control group, matched for average age, English proficiency and gender ratio. Critical thinking levels were measured before and after the intervention using a standardised assessment tool. In the experimental group, students used AI tools (ChatGPT-3.5, Bodoudou, SummarizBot, etc.) to generate and answer text-related questions, and participate in interactive quizzes and AI-assisted debates during classes, while the control group followed traditional methods without AI tools. The findings revealed a statistically significant improvement in the critical thinking skills of the experimental group compared to the control group, as measured by pre and postintervention assessments (p < 0.05). This suggests that AI tools can effectively enhance critical thinking abilities in English literature classes. This study not only contributes to the emerging discourse on AI in education but also offers practical implications for integrating AI technologies to support and enrich the learning experiences of EFL students in literature classes. The findings have the potential to guide educators and policymakers in designing AI-driven educational strategies that are culturally responsive and pedagogically effective.

AB  - The success of deep-learning algorithms in analyzing complex structured and unstructured multidi- mensional data has caused an exponential increase in the amount of research devoted to the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine in the past decade. Public release of large language models like ChatGPT the past year has generated an unprecedented storm of excitement and rumors of machine intelligence finally reaching or even surpassing human capability in detecting meaningful signals in complex multivariate data. Such enthusiasm, however, is met with an equal degree of both skepticism and fear over the social, legal, and moral implications of such powerful technology with relatively little safeguards or regulations on its development. The question remains in medicine of how to harness the power of AI to improve patient outcomes by increasing the diagnostic accuracy and treatment precision provided by medical professionals. Military medicine, given its unique mission and resource constraints,can benefit immensely from such technology. However, reaping such benefits hinges on the ability of the rising generations of military medical professionals to understand AI algorithms and their applications. Additionally, they should strongly consider working with them as an adjunct decision-maker and view them as a colleague to access and harness relevant information as opposed to something to be feared. Ideas expressed in this commentary were formulated by a military medical student during a two-month research elective working on a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists and clinicians at the National Library of Medicine advancing the state of the art of AI in medicine. A motivation to incorporate AI in the Military Health System is provided, including examples of applications in military medicine. Rationale is then given for inclusion of AI in education starting in medical school as well as a prudent implementation of these algorithms in a clinical workflow during graduate medical education. Finally, barriers to implementation are addressed along with potential solutions. The end state is not that rising military physicians are technical experts in AI; but rather that they understand how they can leverage its rapidly evolving capabilities to prepare for a future where AI will have a significant role in clinical care. The overall goal is to develop trained clinicians that can leverage these technologies to improve the Military Health System.

AB  - The rapid advancement of Language Model technologies has opened new opportunities, but also introduced new challenges related to bias and fairness. This paper explores the uncharted territory of potential biases in state-of-the-art universal text embedding models towards specific document and query writing styles within Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Our investigation reveals that different embedding models exhibit different preferences for document writing style, while more informal and emotive styles are less favored by most embedding models. In terms of query writing styles, many embedding models tend to match the query style with the retrieved document style, but some show a consistent preference for specific styles. Text embedding models fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by LLMs display a consistent preference for certain style of generated data. These biases in text embedding based IR systems can inadvertently silence or marginalize certain communication styles, thereby posing a significant threat to fairness in information retrieval. Finally, we also compare the answer styles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on different LLMs and find out that most text embedding models are biased towards LLM's answer styles when used as evaluation metrics for answer correctness. This study sheds light on the critical issue of writing style based bias in IR systems, offering valuable insights for the development of more fair and robust models.

AB  - Designing dialog tutors has been challenging as it involves modeling the diverse and complex pedagogical strategies employed by human tutors. Although there have been significant recent advances in neural conversational systems using large language models and growth in available dialog corpora, dialog tutoring has largely remained unaffected by these advances. In this paper, we rigorously analyze various generative language models on two dialog tutoring datasets for language learning using automatic and human evaluations to understand the new opportunities brought by these advances as well as the challenges we must overcome to build models that would be usable in real educational settings. We find that although current approaches can model tutoring in constrained learning scenarios when the number of concepts to be taught and possible teacher strategies are small, they perform poorly in less constrained scenarios. Our human quality evaluation shows that both models and ground-truth annotations exhibit low performance in terms of equitable tutoring, which measures learning opportunities for students and how engaging the dialog is. To understand the behavior of our models in a real tutoring setting, we conduct a user study using expert annotators and find a significantly large number of model reasoning errors in 45% of conversations. Finally, we connect our findings to outline future work.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) alters the societal landscape and transforms people's lives. In the realm of education, AI offers many opportunities and challenges in teaching and learning. While AI holds promise in enriching learning experiences and fostering motivation, its successful integration into educational practice necessitates that both students and teachers possess digital competence. Education plays a critical role in preparing future workforces. In South America, Brazil stands as the most populous country, with 212.6 million people. The utilisation of AI generative tools, such as ChatGPT, for teaching purposes in the country, is on the rise, albeit constrained within the educational context. Challenges faced in integrating AI generative tools in Brazil’s education system include the facilitation of plagiarism and teachers’ insufficient digital competence. In an effort to delve into the intricacies of teachers’ experiences and challenges regarding the integration of AI generative tools into their pedagogical practice, a qualitative study was conducted, and nine teachers in an upper secondary school in Brazil answered a questionnaire involving seven open questions. The teachers perceive the integration of AI generative tools into teaching practice as an instrument that enhances opportunities for improving the quality of teaching, stimulating student interest, and enriching the dynamism of the content learning process. Teachers have highlighted ChatGPT as a valuable tool for research and consultation. This tool can simplify teaching tasks and is typically well-received by students. Both teachers and students can utilise this tool to generate materials such as lyrics and textual variations and even produce fully composed songs ready for listening. ChatGPT is also used to prepare and correct assessments, ensuring consistency in evaluation. Teachers use AI to prepare texts, quizzes, and multiple-choice tests. AI-generated images are also used to enhance illustrations, making learning materials more engaging and visually appealing. Although AI simplifies complex subjects and makes the learning process more engaging, it is essential to provide adequate training on AI tools to enhance student involvement and educational results.

AB  - As an emerging research area since generative artificial intelligence (represented by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT)) has been accessible to the public, especially in education, appropriate AI application could bring numerous benefits to education; however, its abuse has the potential to be harmful. In this paper, we aimed to explore the potential of AI in the future of education with the analytical method of evolutionary game analysis (EGA). By studying the behavior of two agents, the school and the students, EGA can be used to identify strategies that can be used to improve the effectiveness of the education model in the context of the AI era. A stable evolutionary strategy for the school and students was devised under a variety of scenarios. Additionally, we conducted a numerical analysis to further explore the impact of several key factors on the stable strategy. The results indicated that schools should adopt positive supervision to standardize the use of AI in education, and students should be more active in becoming involved in AI technology. Based on this study, we believe that the school has the ability to provide effective suggestions and practical guidelines to help students succeed academically and embrace future trends in AI education.

AB  - The study of the interaction between STEM education and artificial intelligence is relevant for ensuring academic integrity because of the need to guarantee the efficacy and impartiality of the educational process, which must align with contemporary technological demands and ethical standards. The objective of this research article is to identify the challenges and potential for the utilisation of artificial intelligence in the development of STEM education programmes and curricula. This article examines the efficacy of current preventive measures against students' misuse of AI technologies in the context of STEM education. In the course of composing the research article, the authors employed a systematic approach to analysing and generalising the findings of their review of the literature, with the objective of identifying the critical aspects of academic integrity in the use of artificial intelligence in STEM education. The study employed expert assessment to collate data on the total number of coursework items examined and the number of works in which the GPT detector identified indications of AI usage. The calculation of the percentage of violations of academic integrity through the use of artificial intelligence to the total number of coursework for each speciality revealed that the percentage of violations of academic integrity is greater at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, where the coursework was checked for the first time for the use of AI (7.46%), than at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (4.03%), where the check is carried out for two semesters. Concurrently, there is an emerging concern regarding the increasing incidence of academic integrity violations facilitated by AI technologies. This necessitates the formulation of transparent guidelines governing the deployment of AI in the educational sphere, enhancements to the assessment framework, and the integration of AI-based detection tools into the evaluation of student performance. Moreover, it is imperative to cultivate a heightened ethical consciousness among both students and educators.

AB  - Purpose To identify exemplary medical education curricula, operationalized as curricula evaluating knowledge retention and/or clinical skills acquisition, for health care for sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) individuals and individuals born with a difference in sex development (DSD). Method The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ERIC, Embase, PsycINFO, and the gray literature to identify studies that (1) pertained to undergraduate and/or graduate medical education, (2) addressed education on health care of SGM/DSD individuals, and (3) assessed knowledge retention and/or clinical skills acquisition in medical trainees. The final searches were run in March 2019 and rerun before final analyses in June and October 2020. Results Of 670 full-text articles reviewed, 7 met the inclusion criteria. Five of the 7 studies assessed trainee knowledge retention alone, 1 evaluated clinical skills acquisition alone, and 1 evaluated both outcomes. Studies covered education relevant to transgender health, endocrinology for patients born with DSDs, and HIV primary care. Only 1 study fully mapped to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) SGM/DSD competency recommendations. Six studies reported institutional funding and development support. No studies described teaching SGM/DSD health care for individuals with multiply minoritized identities or engaging the broader SGM/DSD community in medical education curriculum development and implementation. Conclusions Curriculum development in SGM/DSD health care should target knowledge retention and clinical skills acquisition in line with AAMC competency recommendations. Knowledge and skill sets for responsible and equitable care are those that account for structures of power and oppression and cocreate curricula with people who are SGM and/or born with DSDs.

AB  - Implicit biases involve associations outside conscious awareness that lead to a negative evaluation of a person based on individual characteristics. Early evaluation of implicit bias in medical training can prevent long-term adverse health outcomes related to racial bias. However, to our knowledge, no present studies examine the sequential assessment of implicit bias through the different stages of medical training. The objective of this narrative review is to examine the breadth of existing publications that assess implicit bias at the current levels of medical training, pre-medical, graduate, and postgraduate. Protocol for this study was drafted using the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Reviews (SANRA). Keyword literature search on peer-reviewed databases Google Scholar, PubMed, Ebsco, ScienceDirect, and MedEd Portal from January 1, 2017, to March 1, 2022, was used to identify applicable research articles. The online database search identified 1,512 articles. Full screening resulted in 75 papers meeting the inclusion criteria. Over 50% of extracted papers (74%) were published between 2019 and 2021 and investigated implicit bias at the post-graduate level (43%), followed by the graduate level (34%), and pre-medical level (9.4%). Fourteen percent were classified as mixed. Studies at the medical and medical graduate level identified an implicit preference towards white, male, non-LGBTQIA+, thin, patients. Study findings highlight notable gaps within the sequential assessment of implicit bias, specifically at the pre-medical training level. Longitudinal epidemiological research is needed to examine the long-term effect of implicit biases on existing healthcare disparities.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in education, including Islamic religious education, where it offers new opportunities to enhance learning methodologies. This study aims to analyze the integration of AI in Islamic education by evaluating its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) while categorizing its impact on cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains based on Bloom’s Taxonomy. A qualitative approach using library research methodology was employed, with data collected from academic journals, books, and research reports, analyzed through a SWOT framework. The findings indicate that AI significantly enhances cognitive and psychomotor learning in Islamic education. AI-based tools, such as ClassPoint AI, AI Chatbots, and Squirrel AI, contribute to knowledge retention, adaptive learning, and skill-based training in areas like Quranic recitation, prayer practices, and Islamic jurisprudence. However, AI remains limited in fostering affective learning, as it lacks human emotional intelligence and the ability to provide moral and ethical guidance, which are essential in Islamic education. The study also reveals challenges such as ethical concerns, technological disparities, and socio-cultural resistance in integrating AI into religious studies. Despite these limitations, AI presents significant opportunities, particularly in remote learning, personalized education, and accessibility for underserved communities. This research provides a structured evaluation of AI’s role within Bloom’s Taxonomy, offering insights into AI’s potential and limitations in Islamic education. The study contributes theoretically by linking AI-driven education with pedagogical principles, while practically, it guides educators and policymakers in strategically implementing AI while preserving Islamic ethical values. The study concludes that while AI enhances knowledge acquisition and skill-based learning, human educators remain essential for moral and ethical development. Future research should focus on developing ethical AI models, hybrid AI-human teaching approaches, and AI-driven affective learning systems to bridge gaps in AI-assisted moral and spiritual education.

AB  - This research full paper describes a web-based online learning platform that delivers financial literacy lessons via talking head videos of AI-generated personas with two additional core features: LLM-powered proactive chat-based question-and-answer interactivity, and personal choice of the AI instructor from a list of distinct personas. We conducted two comparative studies with a total of 233 Thai students aged 1825, which aim to 1) investigate the impact of interactivity and instructor selection on the learning experience, and 2) further explore the underlying factors at play with instructor selection by introducing AI instructors&#x0027; backstories as an extra intervention. We found that enabling interactivity significantly enhanced learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and virtual instructors&#x0027; humanness compared to the passive setting. Providing learners with a choice of AI instructors provided minimal additional benefit. However, the learner&#x0027;s feeling of relatedness toward the instructor is a significant positive predictor of learning motivation, positive emotion, and agent credibility, while goal alignment with the agent correlates with perceived learning facilitation, and admiration corresponds with perceived agent humanness. These findings underscore the potential of interactive virtual instructors-ones that interactively encourage learners to reflect on the teaching materials throughout the lesson through two-way interaction-in enhancing motivational and experiential aspects of remote education, even if they do not significantly impact comprehension, and the importance of promoting learner&#x0027;s relatedness and goal alignment with the agent in boosting other aspects of the learning experience.

AB  - This research-to-practice full paper describes the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is included in higher education curricula in developing countries. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape societies worldwide, the demand for comprehensive AI education has grown significantly. Despite the widespread adoption of AI and machine learning technologies, there remains a substantial gap in AI education, particularly in developed and developing countries. A recent study highlights that only a small percentage (6&#x0025;) of educators have integrated AI tools like ChatGPT outside of STEM fields, with many (32&#x0025;) expressing the need for further familiarity with such technologies [1]. On the other hand, it is a stark reality that students age 7&#x2013;17 are adopting and using AI technology daily faster than educators [1]. While growing support for AI in education among critical stakeholders, developing countries are searching for effective ways to integrate AI tools into the curriculum and enhance student learning experiences. As a case study, this research study focuses on Azerbaijan, as a developing country. This research focuses on two main subjects: understanding the barriers and challenges of educators and administrative leaders and exploring the effective ways to achieve positive integration of AI tools into the curriculum and enhance student learning experiences. The study involved undergraduate and graduate faculty members and administrative leaders from educational institutions in Azerbaijan. The participants represented public and private universities participated AI training and their AI knowledge and leadership confidence assessed through pre- and post-tests in three key categories: AI Foundation Knowledge, AI Knowledge of Ethical Behavior, and AI Leadership Confidence. The results demonstrated positive changes in participants&#x0027; knowledge and confidence levels post-training, emphasizing the significance of providing educators with robust training to enhance their AI literacy and teaching competencies. This AI training program not only addressed the existing gaps in developing countries related to AI education but also paved the way for a more inclusive and effective learning environment, system thinking and process mapping that prepares students for an AI-driven future. By empowering educators with the necessary knowledge and skills, educational institutions can better integrate AI concepts into their curricula, ultimately equipping students with the tools needed to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. This research serves as a valuable case study for other developing countries seeking to enhance their AI education initiatives and underscores the importance of fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation in education.

AB  - Although information technology (ICT) education is being strengthened based on the national context, there are reports suggesting a decline in young people's communication skills. This phenomenon can be attributed to the rapid development of informatisation, which includes the diversification and spread of information tools, as well as the prevalence of nonverbal communication, such as pictograms in social networking services. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically reduced face-to-face communication opportunities, making interactive communication in on-demand classes challenging. Even in assignments and short tests completed during class, many instances of content being copied and pasted from the web or written in a disorganized manner have been observed. For instance, students entering ICT-related careers, particularly those graduating from the faculty of informatics, must possess the ability to communicate with engineers and clients while implementing ICT advance-ments. Alongside programming skills, strong communication abilities are essential. Moreover, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and Bing AI, has considerably diminished the opportunities for independent thinking. In the current era of enhanced ICT education, AI, and IoT, the Faculty of Informatics at the Kanagawa Institute of Technology has been engaged in discussions regard-ing learning materials that aim to strengthen students’ ability to think and communicate in their own words, preventing the mechanisation of individuals. This paper presents the development and implementation of learning materials designed to enhance students’ verbal communication skills through the description and re-production of mathematical graphs.

AB  - Autonomous manipulation in robot arms is a complex and evolving field of study in robotics. This paper introduces an innovative approach to this challenge by focusing on imitation learning (IL). In contrast to traditional imitation methods, our approach uses IL based on bilateral control, allowing for more precise and adaptable robot movements. Conventional IL based on bilateral control method relies on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. In this paper, we present the IL for robots using position and torque information based on Bilateral control with Transformer (ILBiT). This proposed method employs the Transformer model, known for its robust performance in handling diverse datasets and its capability to overcome LSTM, especially in tasks requiring detailed force adjustments. A highlighting feature of ILBiT is its high-frequency operation at 100 Hz, which significantly improves the system’s adaptability and response to varying environments and objects with different hardness levels. The effectiveness of the ILBiT method is demonstrated through comprehensive real-world experiments.

AB  - Purpose: Psoriasis (Ps) and leprosy are chronic inflammatory skin disorders, characterised by enhanced innate and adaptive immunity. Ps and leprosy rarely coexist. The molecular immune mechanism of the Ps and leprosy rarely coexistence is unclear. Patients and Methods: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 20 patients with Ps, 5 adults with lepromatous leprosy (L-lep), and 5 patients with tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep) to analyse the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between them. Moreover, the biological mechanism of Ps and leprosy was explored by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis analysis, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses. Finally, 13 DEGs of 10 skin biopsies of Ps patients, 6 samples of L-lep patients, 6 samples of T-lep patients and 5 healthy controls were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The PPI network was constructed and primarily associated with immune response, IL-17 signalling, and Toll-like receptor pathway between Ps and leprosy. Th17 markers (interleukin (IL)-19, IL-20, IL-36A, IL-36G, IL-22, IL-17A, and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) had higher expression in Ps than in L-lep and T-lep, whereas macrophage biomarkers (CLEC4E and TREM2), SPP1, and dendritic cell (DC)-related hallmarks (ITGAX) and TNF-a had significantly lower expression across Ps and T-lep than in L-lep. Conclusion: To put it simply, Ps patients with IL-17A, IL-19, IL-20, IL-36A, IL-36G, and IL-22 in conjunction with LCN2 with up-graduated expression might be not susceptible to L-lep. However, high levels of CLEC4E, TREM2, and SPP1 in L-lep patients indicated that they unlikely suffered from Ps.

AB  - Few studies have examined the mental health of clinical psychology doctoral students, a unique group given their education and training in psychopathology, assessment, and intervention. Students (N = 912) completed an online survey assessing demographics, mental health, mental healthcare utilization, and barriers to care during graduate school. Nearly 25% of participants reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, 20% reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression or suicidal intent (SI), and more than 10% reported a high risk of alcohol abuse or moderate to severe drug use during graduate school. In comparison to peers, ethnic minority and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) participants reported more symptoms of depression and SI. LGBTQ+ participants reported more nonsuicidal self-injury and drug use. Participants also experienced significant barriers to receiving mental healthcare (e.g., financial difficulties, limited availability, insufficient time). Leadership is encouraged to prioritize the mental health of clinical psychology doctoral students, which may have implications on their service provision.

As well as shops or restaurants that sell food, has ready-to-eat foods that only lasts one day and then treated as expired food. Often this precious food is thrown in the trash, and meanwhile, many destitute people cannot eat enough per day. Therefore, this research paper aims to mobilize people who overeat and donate their excess food that can still be consumed to those in need. This smartphone application is equipped with activities such as registering for new donors who want to join the mobile application and logging in for donors who are already registered in the mobile application. Donors can monitor couriers taking photos of recipients with food donated from donors. In addition, donors can select the food category for donation and input amount, track the donated food that the courier has picked up, and send it to the recipient. This mobile application is also equipped with donors to share experiences, ideas, and views based on topics created by staff and available threads.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increases in depression for sexual minority people. However, there has been limited attention to whether its negative impact differs across subgroups of sexual minority people or to whether its negative impact is prospectively associated with increases in depressive symptoms. To address these gaps, the present study examined demographic differences in the negative impact of COVID-19 on sexual minority people and whether the negative impact of COVID-19 was associated with increases in depressive symptoms one- and two-months later. A total of 695 sexual minority young adults completed surveys at three time points (baseline, one-month follow-up, and two-month follow-up). Results indicated that younger age, identifying as transgender/gender diverse or as a cisgender woman, and being a full-time student were associated with being more negatively impacted by the pandemic. Furthermore, the negative impact of COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms at the two-month follow-up. However, this became nonsignificant after adjusting for baseline levels of depressive symptoms, likely due to its strong association with subsequent levels. Findings provide preliminary support for within-group heterogeneity in the negative impact of COVID-19 on sexual minority people and for the negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health in this population. Public Significance Statement—Among sexual minority people, certain groups (e.g., transgender/gender diverse, cisgender women, full-time students) have experienced a greater negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic than others, and being negatively impacted by the pandemic is associated with worse mental health. Policies and interventions should prioritize minimizing the negative effects of the pandemic on the groups that are most negatively affected.

AB  - Background: Increasing the size and diversity of the nursing workforce is an important priority. Here, we describe a student success program to increase students' perceived support, coping, and self-efficacy for completing the nursing program among underrepresented racial/ethnic minority students in nursing education following the dual pandemics of COVID-19 and racial injustice. Methods: In collaboration with the Urban Health Program at the University of Illinois Chicago, we conducted a 15-week online student success pilot program with a volunteer sample of upper-level undergraduate nursing students. The curriculum for the program included topics centered on traditional student success topics and psychological, emotional, and contextual issues associated with student success. The sessions were conducted weekly throughout the Spring and Fall semesters of 2021, lasting 90-min. Quality improvement evaluations included weekly process variables and a post-test assessment. Results: Participants (N = 35) were primarily female and Hispanic. The program was acceptable, with participants very satisfied with the weekly sessions (83 %). Post-evaluations revealed self-reported improvements in peer support (69 %), confidence in reaching educational goals (94 %), handling microaggressions (77 %), coping with adversity (80 %), stress levels (63 %), and thoughts about leaving the program (86 %). Conclusions: This student success program shows promise for improving general and minority-specific factors associated with student success. Additional development and evaluation are needed to determine the program's benefits for a larger group of nursing students.

AB  - The article analyses the implementation and efficacy of artificial intelligence in teaching English to first-year students at the Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University. The present study examined the effects of AI chatbots on students' speaking abilities and overall experiences in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom. The participants were 11 EFL teachers and 51 Abai University students, who were randomly assigned into two groups: an experimental cohort and a control cohort. The experimental group, consisting of over 26 students, received instruction through AI-based educational programs, while the control group, comprising over 25 students, received instruction through traditional teaching methods. Employing a pre-and post-test research design, the present study undertook a comparative analysis of students' progress in English speaking skills, both within and between experimental and control groups. The findings of the conducted tests have indicated that both groups exhibited a significant improvement in their oral communicative abilities, as evidenced by their performance in the two speaking tasks, namely reading a text aloud and answering questions. As for the student's proficiency and fluency, it was observed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of pronunciation. However, a discernible variation was detected in their intonation and stress patterns during the reading task. The results of this questionnaire offer an analysis of students' attitudes and opinions regarding integrating AI chatbots into language learning. This sheds light on the potential benefits and limitations of utilising such technology in the EFL context. Furthermore, the recent study explores the potential of AI chatbots as an effective tool to facilitate language learning and their future applications in the EFL setting. The implications of the research findings are thoroughly discussed, considering how AI chatbots can potentially enhance language learning and their potential usefulness in EFL education in the future.

CFA results supported the retention of auditory working memory (AWM) but not quantitative reasoning (QR) as narrow dimensions in an extended WISC-V measurement model. Additional results from models explicating the structures for each of the posited ancillary composite-level indexes (nonverbal [NVI], general ability [GAI], cognitive processing [CPI]) provided support, in part, that these indexes represent global dimensions with differing degrees of generality. Though some of these scores may be used in the manner intended by the test publisher (e.g., comparing and contrasting performance on different composites, specific learning disability identification), provisional limitations for using the ancillary indexes as a focal point of clinical decision-making are discussed.

AB  - Conversion therapies are practices that attempt to change an individuals’ same-sex attractions through psychotherapeutic and aversive therapeutic techniques. Conversion therapies were developed based on homophobic beliefs that same-sex attractions are a mental illness. We sought to describe the prevalence and characteristics of conversion therapy experienced among middle-aged and older men who have sex with men in the USA. Given associations of homophobic stigma and HIV risk, we hypothesized that HIV-positive men would report higher odds of conversion therapy compared to HIV-negative men. We analyzed data from 1237 middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM) enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Among participants, 17.7% reported lifetime conversion therapy, of which the average start of therapy age was 22.67 (sd = 10.56) years, 25.8% reported therapy durations of 6+ months, 37.7% reported session frequencies 1+ session per week, and 35.9% indicated that undergoing therapy was either a little or not at all their decision. We observed no statistically significant association between reporting lifetime conversion therapy and HIV status. Future efforts should continue to assess the magnitude of harm conversion therapies imposed on MSM’s health across the life course as well as test potential, indirect associations that may link these practices to HIV.

AB  - The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) adolescent population experiences health disparities due to barriers to care, including lack of access to culturally competent health care providers. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase access to culturally competent care through continuing education, a physical makeover of clinic space, and a social marketing campaign. The impact of the project on the number of LGBTQ+ adolescent patients at the clinic and the rate of documentation of sexual orientation and gender identity data was evaluated via a chart audit. Changes in nurses’ and health care providers’ knowledge as a result of the continuing education were evaluated with a pretest and a posttest. The number of LGBTQ+ patients and provider knowledge increased following the continuing education. Sexual orientation and gender identity data were documented during 87.5% of visits. The participants’ knowledge increased by 4.7% following the continuing education. Further, five physical changes to the clinic were completed and a social marketing campaign was launched. This quality improvement project demonstrates that continuing education can be an effective way to increase cultural competence for the care of LGBTQ+ individuals.

AB  - At the University of Bologna, one of the pioneers of higher education in Europe and the institution that inspired the name of the Bologna Process, courses are labelled according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), a statistical classification of vocational fields. In Open and Distance Learning (ODL), where the number of programmes is high in parallel with the number of learners, determining the fields of courses taught is crucial not only for measurement and evaluation processes but also for a detailed examination of statistical information in processes such as enrolment and graduation. Processes such as data classification according to specific categories can be rapidly carried out with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and can be utilised in administrative processes. This study investigated whether ChatGPT-4, one of the AI applications, could classify 1135 courses taught at Anadolu University's Open Education System (AUOES), which is part of the Bologna Process, according to ISCED fields, considering the content of the courses. In this study, document analysis was applied to the data analysis. According to the results, the highest number of courses in AUOES were in business, administration, and law (386), while the fewest courses were in education (27). These results indicate that courses related to white-collar professions are taught frequently and are influenced by the programmes at AUOES. This study suggests that AI can be used in administrative processes and to classify courses according to ISCED fields. Categorising all courses according to ISCED or a similar standard could enable the analysis of courses in vocational fields. Determining the fields of courses according to certain standardisations in ODL could allow the courses, and consequently, the books and materials, to be handled by subject matter experts. Decision-makers in ODL could plan the teaching of courses in line with needs by considering the employment situation in vocational fields when launching new programmes or updating course lists. Researchers could investigate the accuracy of AI's processes in administrative tasks and gather the opinions of subject matter experts, opening up new avenues for further research and exploration in the field of AI in education.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are currently designed and tested in many fields to improve humans’ ability to make decisions. One of these fields is higher education. For example, AI-based chatbots (“conversational pedagogical agents”) could engage in conversations with students in order to provide timely feedback and responses to questions while the learning process is taking place and to collect data to personalize the delivery of course materials. However, many existent tools are able to perform tasks that human professionals (educators, tutors, professors) could perform, just in a timelier manner. While discussing the possible implementation of AI-based tools in our university’s educational programs, we reviewed the current literature and identified a number of capabilities that future AI solutions may feature, in order to improve higher education processes, with a focus on distance higher education. Specifically, we suggest that innovative tools could influence the methodologies by which students approach learning; facilitate connections and information attainment beyond course materials; support the communication with the professor; and, draw from motivation theories to foster learning engagement, in a personalized manner. Future research should explore high-level opportunities represented by AI for higher education, including their effects on learning outcomes and the quality of the learning experience as a whole.

AB  - Background Transgender medicine is an emergent subfield with clearly identified educational gaps. Aims This manuscript evaluates a gender-affirming healthcare curriculum for second-year medical (M2) students. Methods Students received a survey assessing Gender Identity Competency in terms of skills, knowledge and attitudes regarding transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) issues. The authors administered the survey before and after the delivery of the curriculum. The curriculum included five online modules, a quiz, a 3-hour case-based workshop and a 2-hour interactive patient-provider panel. Results Approximately 60% of M2 students (n=77) completed both preassessments and postassessments. The following showed a statistically significant improvement from preassessment to postassessment: student Gender Identity Competency, t(76) =-11.07, p<0.001; skills, t(76) =-15.22, p<0.001; and self-reported knowledge, t(76) =-4.36, p<0.001. Negative attitudes did not differ (p=0.378). Interest in TGNC issues beyond healthcare settings did not change (p=0.334). M2 students reported a significant change in experience role-playing chosen pronouns in a clinical setting, t(76) =-8.95, p<0.001. Conclusions The curriculum improved students' gender-affirming medical competency, knowledge and skills. The development of a sustained, longitudinal curriculum is recommended in addition to the continuing education of faculty to reinforce this expanding knowledge and skills base and to address discomfort working with this population.

AB  - This systematic review explores the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in enhancing intercultural communication competence (ICC) at the university level. As AI increasingly integrates into educational settings, its potential to revolutionize student learning and cultural interactions is profound. The review synthesizes findings from 11 empirical studies conducted globally, assessing the impact of AI-driven tools, such as chatbots and virtual reality simulations, on students' ability to handle cultural differences. While AI offers significant benefits in personalizing learning and fostering immersive cultural experiences, challenges remain, particularly in ensuring cultural sensitivity and addressing inequalities in technology access. The review stresses the need for careful integration of AI in education, cautioning the audience about potential pitfalls and emphasizing the importance of human oversight to reduce biases and enhance cultural understanding. The pedagogical implications stress the importance of blending AI with traditional teaching methods to create inclusive learning environments that prepare students for globalized society's demands. The review also identifies areas for future research, including the long-term impact of AI on ICC and the ethical considerations surrounding AI use in education. In the end, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI's role in shaping the future of intercultural education.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore differences in the clinical psychology PhD program admissions experience (i.e., interviewing and decision-making) by race/ethnicity and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) identity. Methods: Participants were 803 students (24% racial/ethnic minority; 19% LGBTQ) enrolled in US clinical psychology PhD programs. Two-group comparisons tested for differences in admission experiences by race/ethnicity and LGBTQ identity. Results: Racial/ethnic minority and LGBTQ students considered a programmatic commitment to diversity as more important in application decisions compared to non-Hispanic White and cisgender heterosexual students, respectively. LGBTQ students were more likely to be advised to not discuss personal information (e.g., sexual orientation) than cisgender heterosexual students. Racial/ethnic minority and LGBTQ students identified financial considerations and program outcomes as more important in their decision-making compared with non-Hispanic White and cisgender heterosexual students, respectively. Conclusion: Increasing funding and fostering authentic training environments should be prioritized in institutional conversations around recruiting racial/ethnic minority and LGBTQ trainees.

AB  - The objective of this analysis was to describe individual and structural-level factors associated with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among a sample of sexual and gender minorities (SGM) at risk for HIV recruited using limited interaction strategies. SGM (N = 3330), ages 15–34, without HIV enrolled in a nationwide limited interaction cohort study from 2017 to 2020. A baseline cross-sectional single-survey design examined individual and structural-level correlates of PrEP lifetime use and current use using logistic regression. PrEP lifetime use and current use were reported by 31.2% and 23.9%, respectively, of SGM with PrEP data (n = 3077). PrEP use outcomes (lifetime or current use) in cisgender MSM were associated with being over age 18, Black or other race, Hispanic/Latina/x/o ethnicity, being gay, being out to one’s healthcare provider, having health insurance, being a college graduate, and having a greater number of PrEP peers. PrEP use outcomes (lifetime use or current use) in transgender/non-binary participants were associated with being over age 24, being Latinx, being transgender vs. non-binary, being assigned male at birth, being out to their healthcare provider, living in the western or northeastern United States, and having more peers on PrEP. More work is needed to address lower PrEP uptake in SGM under 18 and those whose sex risk may be more dynamic (e.g., non-binary, pansexual/queer, and bisexual SGM) and such strategies should consider utilizing peers to provide information and ameliorate structural barriers.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) impacts sexual minority adolescents at rates equal to or greater than the rate it impacts heterosexual adolescents. We investigated whether reports of physical and sexual IPV were less frequent in school jurisdictions with more affirming climates for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students; and whether these associations varied for sexual orientation subgroups. We combined student-level data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys on demographics and experiences with physical and sexual IPV with jurisdiction-level data from the 2014 School Health Profiles on LGBTQ-affirming school climate. Multilevel logistic regression models examined associations between LGBTQ-affirming school climates and IPV. We stratified our data by sex and examined whether these associations differed by sexual orientation subgroups using cross-level interaction terms between school climate and sexual orientation (assessed via sexual identity and behavior). Sexual minority youth were more likely to report experiencing past-year physical and sexual IPV than their heterosexual counterparts. Attending schools with more LGBTQ-affirming climates reduced the likelihood of reporting physical IPV, but not sexual IPV, for female students. More LGBTQ-affirming school climates increased risk for sexual IPV among gay male students. Establishing LGBTQ-affirming school climates may reduce physical IPV for female students, but may have unintended consequences on sexual IPV prevalence for gay male students. More work is necessary to ensure that these climates are affirming for all sexual minority students and to address sexual violence prevention.

AB  - The professional activity of a university lecturer in Ukraine can be viewed as a problem-solving process that includes both routine and non-routine tasks. It is clear that artificial intelligence tools can improve the effectiveness of lecturers' solving these tasks and save them time. The aim of this study is to determine the state of practice in applying artificial intelligence tools in the professional activities of university lecturers in Ukraine in performing routine tasks. Based on the types of professional activities of a university lecturer in Ukraine-teaching, methodological, and scientific-and having identified possible artificial intelligence tools for solving routine tasks, we created a questionnaire. The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine teachers' attitudes toward the use of artificial intelligence in their professional activities and the artificial intelligence tools used by Ukrainian university teachers. Using the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot in Bing, an online questionnaire consisting of 8 sections and 36 questions was developed. The questionnaire was presented in Google Forms and distributed through social networks and professional associations of teachers. The article presents the results of a survey of 205 university lecturers in Ukraine. It was found that 30.4% of respondents believe they have never used AI, 5.4% use AI daily, and 15.2% weekly. According to self-assessment of knowledge and skills in the field of AI, the distribution by levels is as follows: very high - 0%, high - 4.4%, medium - 41.4%, low - 33.5%, very low - 20.7%. Regarding attitudes toward the use of AI in education: 7.8% are very positive, 43.6% are positive, 43.6% are neutral, 3.9% are negative, and 1% are very negative. The questionnaire also included several questions about AI tools for information retrieval, creating presentations, scheduling classes, generating reports, and creating test assignments. The teachers' answers to the last question of the questionnaire show that it is useful for understanding the possibilities of using artificial intelligence in the professional activities of a university teacher, in particular, teachers have learned more about artificial intelligence tools that can be used to perform routine tasks, which encourages them to study them more deeply.

AB  - A key challenge in education is effectively engaging children in learning activities. We investigated how a narrative story impacts engagement and learning, as well as how feedback can provide further benefits. To do so, we created an interactive, tablet-based learning platform with a multi-step math task designed using Common Core State Standards. Subjects completed a pretest and then were assigned to a condition, either one of three variations of the system (narratives, narratives with hints, and narratives with a tutoring chatbot using wizard-of-oz techniques) or a control system that has children complete the same learning task without narratives nor feedback, before the subjects completed a post test. 72 children in U.S. grades 3 - 5 participated. Our results showed that embedding learning activities into narratives boosted children's engagement as evaluated by coding video responses and surveys, and the integration of a tutoring chatbot improved learning outcomes on the assessment. These results provide evidence that a narrative-based tutoring system with chatbot-mediated help may support effective learning experiences for children.

AB  - Importance: Previous studies have shown high rates of mistreatment among US general surgery residents, leading to poor well-being. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ+) residents represent a high-risk group for mistreatment; however, their experience in general surgery programs is largely unexplored. Objective: To determine the national prevalence of mistreatment and poor well-being for LGBTQ+ surgery residents compared with their non-LGBTQ+ peers. Design, Setting, and Participants: A voluntary, anonymous survey adapting validated survey instruments was administered to all clinically active general surgery residents training in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited general surgery programs following the 2019 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported mistreatment, sources of mistreatment, perceptions of learning environment, career satisfaction, burnout, thoughts of attrition, and suicidality. The associations between LGBTQ+ status and (1) mistreatment, (2) burnout, (3) thoughts of attrition, and (4) suicidality were examined using multivariable regression models, accounting for interactions between gender and LGBTQ+ identity. Results: A total of 6956 clinically active residents completed the survey (85.6% response rate). Of 6381 respondents included in this analysis, 305 respondents (4.8%) identified as LGBTQ+ and 6076 (95.2%) as non-LGBTQ+. Discrimination was reported among 161 LGBTQ+ respondents (59.2%) vs 2187 non-LGBTQ+ respondents (42.3%; P <.001); sexual harassment, 131 (47.5%) vs 1551 (29.3%; P <.001); and bullying, 220 (74.8%) vs 3730 (66.9%; P =.005); attending surgeons were the most common overall source. Compared with non-LGBTQ+ men, LGBTQ+ residents were more likely to report discrimination (men: odds ratio [OR], 2.57; 95% CI, 1.78-3.72; women: OR, 25.30; 95% CI, 16.51-38.79), sexual harassment (men: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.39-2.99; women: OR, 5.72; 95% CI, 4.09-8.01), and bullying (men: OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.07-2.12; women: OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.37-2.91). LGBTQ+ residents reported similar perceptions of the learning environment, career satisfaction, and burnout (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.97-1.52) but had more frequent considerations of leaving their program (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52-2.74) and suicide (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.26-3.04). This increased risk of suicidality was eliminated after adjusting for mistreatment (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.90-2.39). Conclusions and Relevance: Mistreatment is a common experience for LGBTQ+ surgery residents, with attending surgeons being the most common overall source. Increased suicidality among LGBTQ+ surgery residents is associated with this mistreatment. Multifaceted interventions are necessary to develop safer and more inclusive learning environments..

AB  - Chromium (Cr) is the most common heavy metal and that becomes toxic when present at higher concentrations in aquatic environments. Allium mongolicum Regel flavonoids (AMRF) has been documented to possess detoxification, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of dietary AMRF and Cr exposure on bioaccumulation, oxidative stress, and immune response in Ctenopharyngodon idella. After acclimation, 360 fish were randomly distributed into six groups. The fish were fed with diets supplemented with Cr and/or AMRF for 4 weeks (28 days), the Cr concentrations were 0, 120, and 240 mg/kg and the concentrations of AMRF were 0 or 40 mg/kg, respectively. The results shown that Cr accumulation in the kidney, liver, spleen, intestine and gill were significantly increased following Cr exposure, dietary AMRF supplementation attenuated the increased in Cr accumulation. Dietary AMRF supplementation significantly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) in liver, spleen and gill compared with the same Cr dose groups. When fish were supplemented with AMRF significantly increased lysozyme activity (LZM), complement 3 (C3) in kidney and intestine compared with the same Cr dose groups. Serum glutamic oxalate transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT) were significantly increased following exposure to Cr. Dietary AMRF supplementation significantly decreased GOT and GPT activity in the serum. In addition, AMRF supplementation can decrease the expression of inflammatory (NF-κB p65, TNF-α and IL-1β) and increased the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and ZO-1) following Cr exposure in C. idella. These results indicate that AMRF has the potential to alleviate the effects of Cr toxicity in C. idella.

AB  - Men are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections compared to women, but their risk perceptions around COVID-19 are persistently lower. Further, men often engage in less health promotion behavior because self-care in this capacity is seen as weak or less masculine. This combination has consequences for mortality; thus, a better understanding of men’s COVID-19 cognitions and individual difference factors is critical. In a web-based survey conducted during the beginning stages of the pandemic in the U.S., we collected risk perceptions of various sexual and non-sexual behaviors from heterosexual (n = 137) and gay/bisexual men (n = 108). There were no significant sexual orientation differences for perceptions of COVID-19 risk from routine activities or in overall risk estimates. However, gay/bisexual men did report engaging in more precautionary behavior while socializing (i.e., masking, social distancing) and reported higher risk perceptions than did heterosexual men for nearly all intimate and sexual activities. A more nuanced understanding of cognitions around COVID-19 is needed to better understand motivation for—and especially motivation against—pursuing vaccinations and continuing precautionary behavior.

AB  - Autonomous driving has demonstrated impressive driving capabilities, with behavior decision-making playing a crucial role as a bridge between perception and control. Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have introduced innovative approaches to behavior decision-making in autonomous driving, but challenges remain. On one hand, RL’s policy networks often lack sufficient reasoning ability to make optimal decisions in highly complex and stochastic environments. On the other hand, the complexity of these environments leads to low sample efficiency in RL, making it difficult to efficiently learn driving policies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Knowledge Distillation-Enhanced Behavior Transformer (KD-BeT) framework. Building on the successful application of Transformers in large language models, we introduce the Behavior Transformer as the policy network in RL, using observation–action history as input for sequential decision-making, thereby leveraging the Transformer’s contextual reasoning capabilities. Using a teacher–student paradigm, we first train a small-capacity teacher model quickly and accurately through IL, then apply knowledge distillation to accelerate RL’s training efficiency and performance. Simulation results demonstrate that KD-BeT maintains fast convergence and high asymptotic performance during training. In the CARLA NoCrash benchmark tests, KD-BeT outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of traffic efficiency and driving safety, offering a novel solution for addressing real-world autonomous driving tasks.

AB  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) development for Low-Resource Languages (LRL) remains challenging due to limited data availability, linguistic diversity, and computational constraints. Many NLP solutions rely on complex models and high volume/quality data, which makes them difficult to use in Low-Resource NLP. Inspired by the NLP challenges and insights revealed by various previous works, the underexplored Incremental Learning (IL) Static Word Embedding (SWE) system in the low-resource NLP case of Indonesia’s local languages is proposed and presented. With basic-level models and hyperparameter sweeps, these models are tested in the scenario of incrementally incorporating 10 different local languages into themselves. The simulations indicate this type of model resists Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) very well and delivers competitive performance on the downstream task of sentiment analysis. In terms of f1 scores, the proposed model succeeds to exceed other baseline models and even rival heavy Transformer models. The proposed model can be considered as a prospective holistic solution for low-resource NLP. Future works could explore this model’s behavior in finer-grained NLP tasks, different IL settings, or test more advanced models.

AB  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an empirically supported treatment for a variety of clinical concerns and has over 1000 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). ACT may be a potentially effective treatment for racial, sexual orientation and gender diverse people who experience unique stressors related to their identities and higher rates of psychopathology and have unique mental health considerations. Despite this, there remains a lack of inclusion of reporting and inclusion of these communities in psychological research. This lack of inclusion of minority populations limits the generalizability of the findings of RCTs to those populations. Further, although there is a growing number of minority graduate students and trainees, this increased diversity often does not extend to their principal investigators. The current study reviews racial, sexual, and gender minority inclusion of participants as well as of principal investigators in 75 ACT RCTs performed in the United States (n = 10,914). Of these, 73% were White, 11% were Black, 5% were Latine, 3% were Asian, 2% were Native American, 0.4% were Pacific Islander, 0.1% were Middle Eastern, and 3% were multiracial while 1% were reported as Other and another 1% as Unknown. Of the 75 studies reviewed, 5 reported on sexual orientation and 73% of participants were heterosexual, 7% were gay or lesbian, 5% were bisexual, 2% were pansexual, 4% were asexual, 1% were queer, 1% were questioning, and 1% were reported as Other and 7% as Unknown (n = 297). Only two studies reported on gender identity beyond men and women, with one study including all cisgender participants and one study reporting that 2% of participants were nonbinary. Of the 32 PIs that responded, 94% were White, 2% were Mixed, and 2% were Asian. In terms of sexual orientation and gender identity, one PI was gay, one was asexual, and cisgender women authored 26% of studies. These results indicated that despite Black participants being more accurately represented, Latine and Asian participants were largely underrepresented. Regardless of level of representation, the numbers of racial, sexual, and gender minority participants were still limited and therefore conclusions cannot be made about the generalizability of ACT for these populations. Recommendations for more inclusive practices are provided. We discuss limitations to this review and the implications of PI refusal to report their sexual and gender identity.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Conversion therapies to minimize same-sex attractions are classified as a dangerous practice by numerous scientific institutions in the United States. These practices may contribute to poor long-term psychosocial health, thereby interrupting processes of healthy aging. Few studies have examined psychosocial differences between persons with and without prior experiences of conversion therapy. We assessed associations between prior conversion therapy experiences and psychosocial health among midlife and older men who have sex with men (MSM; age 40+ years). Research Design and Methods: Participants included a multicity sample of MSM (N = 1,156) enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study who completed health surveys (2016-2019) as part of their biannual study visits. Using multivariable regressions, we investigated the associations of prior conversion therapy with current depressive symptoms, internalized homophobia, post-traumatic stress, and cumulative psychosocial conditions. Using a trait-level measure (e.g., life purpose and perseverance), we tested whether resilience moderated these associations. Results: The full sample was predominantly non-Hispanic white with a mean age of 62.6 years. Fifteen percent of men (n = 171/1,156) reported prior conversion therapy. In multivariable models, men exposed to conversion therapy were more likely to have depressive symptoms and above-average internalized homophobia. Men exposed to conversion therapy had 2-2.5 times the odds of reporting 1 and ≥2 psychosocial conditions, respectively, compared with those who reported 0 conditions. Resilience did not moderate these associations. Discussion and Implications: Conversion therapies are nonaffirming social stressors for MSM and may compromise critical psychosocial aspects of healthy aging among MSM.

AB  - Objectives: Studies have shown that grit—defined as perseverance and passion for achieving one’s long-term goals—is associated with improved health outcomes, including lower levels of psychological distress. However, the psychometric properties of the original Grit Scale (Grit-O Scale) has not been validated among sexual minority men (SMM). The present study aimed to validate the Grit-O Scale among a sample of older SMM and assess the relationships between the Grit-O Scale factors and symptoms of psychological distress. Method: We used data from a single visit of participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) Healthy Aging longitudinal study. The sample included 981 older SMM (mean age = 61, SD = 8.5) with and without HIV. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to identify the two factors of the Grit-O Scale: consistency of interest and perseverance of effort. We also conducted a latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct profiles of psychological distress from self-reported scales of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. Results:The Grit-O Scale showed acceptable reliability estimates for the items with Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.82. The CFA identified the two factors of the Grit-O Scale with acceptable model fit (root mean square error of approximation = 0.058 [95% CI = 0.050, 0.067], comparative fit index = 0.95, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.93, standardized root mean square residual = 0.07). The LPA yielded three mutually exclusive profiles of psychological distress (profile 1: low stress, anxiety, and depression; profile 2: high stress and depression and low anxiety; and profile 3: high stress, anxiety, and depression). In adjusted multinominal logistic regression analysis, we found that both higher levels of consistency of interest and perseverance of effort factors of the Grit-O Scale were significantly associated with decreased odds of being in profiles 2 and 3 compared with being in profile 1. Conclusion: Our findings support the use of the Grit-O Scale among older SMM. Grit factors could explain variability in the negative psychological symptoms among older SMM and warrant further investigation.

AB  - Little is known about how to best implement eHealth HIV interventions for adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) in real-world settings. In response, our current study describes formative implementation research with community-based organizations (CBOs) in preparation for future implementation of the SMART Program, a stepped-care package of three interventions adapted for AMSM. In-depth interviews focusing on eHealth implementation were conducted with a convenience sample of 12 stakeholders from nine CBOs that actively implemented sexual minority-focused HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Qualitative analysis was conducted using Dedoose to identify salient themes. Most programs implemented at the CBOs engaged adult MSM for HIV prevention, but CBOs reported less experience with outreach of AMSM for HIV prevention. While comfortable with and skilled at implementing traditional in-person HIV prevention programs, interviewees reported that eHealth programs fell outside of their organizations’ technical capacities. They suggested specific strategies to facilitate successful implementation of SMART and other eHealth programs, including technical-capacity-building at CBOs, better training of staff, and partnering with a national coordinating center that provides support for the technology. Overall, the CBOs reported enthusiasm for the SMART Program and thought it was an efficient way to bridge their current gaps in online programming and lack of AMSM HIV prevention strategies.

AB  - Background and Objective: Research related to anxiety among sexual minority men (SMM) typically focuses on risk factors. It has seldom examined factors that may be associated with lower levels of anxiety. This gap in the literature represents an opportunity to explore positive psychological factors that may be related to lower levels of anxiety among this group. Spirituality and self-compassion are two positive psychological factors that have been associated with reduced anxiety in general samples but have been understudied among SMM. This study aimed to determine the longitudinal associations between spirituality, self-compassion, and anxiety. Design and Methods: Guided by an Afrocentric psychological framework, we conducted a secondary quantitative analysis with data from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 697 U.S. SMM. Results: Utilizing Hayes PROCESS Macro Model 4, we found that spirituality at baseline was positively associated with self-compassion at baseline, which in turn was inversely associated with anxiety at 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: Overall, our findings provide evidence that spirituality and self-compassion are two positive psychological factors that are inversely associated with anxiety among SMM.

AB  - Importance: The prevalence of workplace mistreatment and its association with the well-being of emergency medicine (EM) residents is unclear. More information about the sources of mistreatment might encourage residency leadership to develop and implement more effective strategies to improve professional well-being not only during residency but also throughout the physician's career. Objective: To examine the prevalence, types, and sources of perceived workplace mistreatment during training among EM residents in the US and the association between mistreatment and suicidal ideation. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this survey study conducted from February 25 to 29, 2020, all residents enrolled in EM residencies accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) who participated in the 2020 American Board of Emergency Medicine computer-based In-training Examination were invited to participate. A multiple-choice, 35-item survey was administered after the examination asking residents to self-report the frequency, sources, and types of mistreatment experienced during residency training and whether they had suicidal thoughts. Main Outcomes and Measures: The types and frequency of workplace mistreatment and the sources of the mistreatment were identified, and rates of self-reported suicidality were obtained. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine resident and program characteristics associated with suicidal thoughts. Results: Of 8162 eligible EM residents, 7680 (94.1%) responded to at least 1 question on the survey; 6503 (79.7%) completed the survey in its entirety. A total of 243 ACGME-accredited residency programs participated, and 1 did not. The study cohort included 4768 male residents (62.1%), 2698 female residents (35.1%), 4919 non-Hispanic White residents (64.0%), 2620 residents from other racial/ethnic groups (Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian or Pacific Islander, African American, Mexican American, Native Hawaiian, Puerto Rican, other Hispanic, or mixed or other race) (34.1%), 483 residents who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or other (LGBTQ+) (6.3%), and 5951 residents who were married or in a relationship (77.5%). Of the total participants, 3463 (45.1%) reported exposure to some type of workplace mistreatment (eg, discrimination, abuse, or harassment) during the most recent academic year. A frequent source of mistreatment was identified as patients and/or patients' families; 1234 respondents (58.7%) reported gender discrimination, 867 (67.5%) racial discrimination, 282 (85.2%) physical abuse, and 723 (69.1%) sexual harassment from patients and/or family members. Suicidal thoughts occurring during the past year were reported by 178 residents (2.5%), with similar prevalence by gender (108 men [2.4%]; 59 women [2.4%]) and race/ethnicity (113 non-Hispanic White residents [2.4%]; 65 residents from other racial/ethnic groups [2.7%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study, EM residents reported that workplace mistreatment occurred frequently. The findings suggest common sources of mistreatment for which educational interventions may be developed to help ensure resident wellness and career satisfaction..

AB  - The purpose of this research is to create a reliable and valid scale to assess AIlessphobia in Education (the fear of being without Artificial Intelligence in education) among university students. In three phases, a sample of 1378 undergraduate students from different faculties at a public university participated in the reliability and validity investigations of the scale during the academic year 2023–2024. Expert comments were obtained to assess the scale's face validity and content validity. The first group sample (n = 420) underwent exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the second group sample (n = 510) underwent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and the third group sample (n = 448) underwent criterion-related validity testing. EFA revealed that the scale had a two-factor structure with 18 items that explained 56.23% of the total variance. The CFA analysis verified the scale's two-factor structure and produced good fit values (χ2/df = 2.25, CFI =.99; TLI =.99; NFI =.98; IFI =.99; SRMR =.049; RMSEA = 0.050 [0.42–0.57]). The first factor's analysis showed acceptable values for Guttman's lambda (λ = 0.930–0.948), McDonald's omega (ω = 0.923–0.929), and Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.925–0.935). Similarly, the second factor's analysis also showed acceptable values for these measures (λ = 0.851–0.880, ω = 0.850–0.879, α = 0.847–0.877). Overall, the entire scale demonstrated acceptable values for Cronbach's alpha (0.925–0.935), McDonald's omega (0.922–0.942), and Guttman's lambda (0.940–0.942). Additionally, the scale exhibited a positive and statistically significant correlation with the Fırat Netlessphobia Scale, indicating satisfactory criterion validity. Cross-gender invariance analysis was also performed, showing that gender invariance was achieved. The results indicate that this scale is valid and reliable for university students. In conclusion, the scale fills a critical gap in educational research by providing a reliable tool to measure students' fears and anxieties about the absence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their learning experiences. By accurately assessing this unique form of anxiety, educators and policymakers can develop targeted interventions to better understand and mitigate students' fears and support the integration of AI in education, thereby enhancing its constructive contribution to learning.

AB  - Rationale: Loneliness is associated with negative health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, dementia, physical functional decline, depression, and increased mortality risk, among HIV- positive and HIV-negative older men who have sex with men (MSM). Given these negative health outcomes, it is imperative to identify factors that minimize loneliness in these vulnerable groups. Objective: We sought to examine whether social-environmental resiliencies—defined as an individual's level of support, social bonding, and psychological sense of community among gay men—buffer against symptoms of loneliness. Method: We analyzed longitudinal data from 1,255 older MSM with and without HIV infection, all of whom were enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Using longitudinal latent class analysis (LLCA), we identified three underlying classes (Social Connectors, Non-community Connectors, and Social Isolates) in the social environment of the sample. We assessed the prevalence of loneliness by these latent classes. By lagging social environmental factors over time, we were able to examine the temporal relationships between latent classes and subsequent loneliness. Results: Consistent with our hypothesis, multivariate associations revealed that compared to Social Connectors with high levels of social support and social bonding and a strong perceived sense of community among gay men, Social Isolates (Prevalence Ratio (PR): 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08–1.88; p = 0.0120) and Non-community Connectors (PR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03–1.75; p = 0.0322) were more likely to experience loneliness after adjustment for covariates and baseline loneliness. There were no differences by HIV status. Conclusions: These longitudinal data allowed us to make causal inferences related to the social environmental resiliencies lowering the odds of loneliness among HIV-positive and HIV-negative older MSM. Developing individual- and community-level tailored interventions for these populations by leveraging social environmental resiliencies is key to reducing loneliness and promoting health.

AB  - Objective: Heat stroke (HS) elicits the systemic inflammatory responses that result in multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). Heat shock response and autophagy are activated during heat stress for removal of damaged organelles and proteins, emerging as a major regulator of cellular homeostasis. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) is a derivative of pyruvic acid and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aims to investigate the effects of EP on MOD in HS rats and explore the possible mechanisms. Method: Anesthetized rats were placed in a heating chamber (42 °C) to elevate the core body temperature attaining to 42.9 °C. Rats were then moved to room temperature and monitored for 6 h. EP (60 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered 30 min prior to heat exposure. Results: Results showed that EP significantly reduced HS-induced increases in plasma levels of LDH, CPK, GPT and CK-MB, reversed the decrease of platelet counts, and alleviated intestinal mucosal and pulmonary damage. Moreover, EP reduced pro-inflammatory protein, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, HMGB1 and iNOS, and induced stress proteins, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and HSP90 in the liver of HS rats. The levels of HS-activated autophagy-regulatory proteins were affected by EP, in which the phosphorylated mTOR and AKT were reduced, and the phosphorylated AMPK increased, accompanied with upregulation in ULK1, Atg7, Atg12 and LC3II, and downregulation of p62. Conclusion: In conclusion, EP ameliorated HS-induced inflammatory responses and MOD, and the underlying mechanism is associated with the induction of the stress proteins HO-1 and HSP70 as well as restorage of autophagy.

AB  - Background: Snake venom phospholipases A2 (svPLA2) are biologically active toxins, capable of triggering and modulating a wide range of biological functions. Among the svPLA2s, crotoxin (CTX) has been in the spotlight of bioprospecting research due to its role in modulating immune response and hemostasis. In the present study, novel anticoagulant mechanisms of CTX, and the modulation of inflammation-induced coagulation were investigated. Methods: CTX anticoagulant activity was evaluated using platelet poor plasma (PPP) and whole blood (WB), and also using isolated coagulation factors and complexes. The toxin modulation of procoagulant and pro-inflammatory effects was evaluated using the expression of tissue factor (TF) and cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in WB. Results: The results showed that CTX impaired clot formation in both PPP and WB, and was responsible for the inhibition of both intrinsic (TF/factor VIIa) and extrinsic (factor IXa/factor VIIIa) tenase complexes, but not for factor Xa and thrombin alone. In addition, the PLA2 mitigated the prothrombinase complex by modulating the coagulation phospholipid role in the complex. In regards to the inflammation-coagulation cross talk, the toxin was capable of reducing the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, and was followed by decreased levels of TF and procoagulant activity from LPS-treated PBMC either isolated or in WB. Conclusion: The results obtained in the present study recognize the toxin as a novel medicinal candidate to be applied in inflammatory diseases with coagulation disorders.

AB  - This paper brings a comprehensive systematic review of the application of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) in quantitative human geography studies, including the subdomains of cultural, economic, political, historical, urban, population, social, health, rural, regional, tourism, behavioural, environmental and transport geography. In this extensive review, we obtain 14,537 papers from the Web of Science in the relevant fields and select 1516 papers that we identify as human geography studies using GeoAI via human scanning conducted by several research groups around the world. We outline the GeoAI applications in human geography by systematically summarising the number of publications over the years, empirical studies across countries, the categories of data sources used in GeoAI applications, and their modelling tasks across different subdomains. We find out that existing human geography studies have limited capacity to monitor complex human behaviour and examine the non-linear relationship between human behaviour and its potential drivers—such limits can be overcome by GeoAI models with the capacity to handle complexity. We elaborate on the current progress and status of GeoAI applications within each subdomain of human geography, point out the issues and challenges, as well as propose the directions and research opportunities for using GeoAI in future human geography studies in the context of sustainable and open science, generative AI, and quantum revolution.

AB  - In past researches, we had been proved the action mechanism of pre-germinated brown rice (PGBR) to treat metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. This study was to investigate the protective effect of PGBR in high fructose and high fat-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rodents. WKY rats were divided into: Control group was fed normal drinking water and diet; FLD group was fed 10% high-fructose-water (HFW) and high-fat-diet (HFD); PGBR group was given HFW, and HFD mixed PGBR. After four weeks, the body, hepatic and cardiac weight gains of FLD group had significant increases than that of Control group. The enhanced blood pressure and heart rate, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, and higher liver function index (GPT levels) were observed; meanwhile, the IL-6 and TNF-α levels of serum, and TG level of liver were also elevated in FLD group. The related protein expressions of lipid synthesis, inflammation, cardiac fibrosis, and hypertrophy were deteriorated by HFW/HFD. However, in treatment group, PGBR decreased all above influenced parameters, additionally GOT; and related protein expressions. PGBR treated HFW/HFD-induced NAFLD and cardiac complications might be via improving lipid homeostasis, and inhibiting inflammation. Together, PGBR could be used as a healthy food for controlling NAFLD and its' cardiac dysfunction.

AB  - L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) is a metabolic enzyme that converts L-amino acids into ketoacids, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The generated H2O2 has previously been shown to have antibacterial and gut microbiota-modulatory properties in LAO1 knock-out (KO) mice. Since most microbial metabolites reach the liver through the portal vein, we examined gut-liver interactions in LAO1 KO mice. We found lower total cholesterol levels, higher glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels in the serum, and higher pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in the liver tissue. In wild-type (WT) mice, LAO1 was expressed in gut tissues (ileum and colon). Microbiome analysis revealed that the abundance of some bacteria was altered in LAO1 KO mice. However, short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) levels in cecal feces and gut permeability did not change. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) revealed that feces from LAO1 KO mice slightly stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the liver. During metabolomic analysis, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was the only metabolite found to be significantly upregulated in the portal and abdominal veins of the LAO1 KO mice. Intraperitoneal administration of 5-ALA to WT mice significantly increased IL-6 mRNA expression in the liver. These observations suggest that gut LAO1 plays a role in regulating 5-ALA production and that a high level of 5-ALA stimulates the liver to increase pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by disrupting LAO1 in mice.

AB  - Primary care providers often express a desire to be more involved with their patients as they transition to hospice care. Given that these providers have a central role in the care of their patients, they have the potential to significantly improve the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer patients who face serious illnesses. This article discusses the barriers to quality hospice and palliative care experienced by many sexual and gender minorities, as well as specific ways in which primary care physicians can promote equitable end-of-life care.

AB  - Introduction: Our study sought to assess the interplay of family dynamics, namely familial warmth and LGBTQ + specific rejection, and its association to self-esteem in a non-probabilistic sample of LGBTQ + adolescents in the United States. Methods: Stratified by (1) cisgender and (2) transgender and non-binary LGBTQ + adolescents (N = 8774), we tested multivariable regression analyses to assess the association between familial warmth and LGBTQ + specific family rejection, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. We then conducted a sub-analysis with LGBTQ + adolescents who reported being out to any family member about their LGBTQ + identity; specifically, we tested a series of multivariable regression models to assess whether levels of LGBTQ + specific family rejection attenuated the association between familial warmth and self-esteem. Results: Full sample models indicated a positive association between familial warmth and self-esteem. Findings from our sub-analysis indicated that familial warmth remained positively linked to self-esteem and family rejection was negatively associated with self-esteem. Family rejection was a statistically significant moderator, attenuating the association between familial warmth and self-esteem. With respect to being out about one's sexual orientation, these findings were robust across gender stratification groups. Conclusions: Families of origin serve as sources of stress and resilience for LGBTQ + adolescents. Our findings contribute support to arguments that familial warmth and LGBTQ + specific rejection are not mutually-exclusive experiences among LGBTQ + adolescents. We provide recommendations for multilevel interventions to leverage activities that support positive family dynamics and self-esteem among LGBTQ + adolescents.

AB  - Objective: The current study examined suicide-related disclosure intentions in LGBTQ + youth, and the associations between reporting of lifetime experiences of minority stress and intentions to disclose suicidal thoughts. Method: A sample of 592 LGBTQ + youth ages 12–24 (22.3% cisgender men, 33.1% cisgender women, 44.6% gender diverse, 75.3% white) who contacted an LGBTQ-specific crisis service, completed a survey. Results: Youth reported highest intentions to disclose future suicidal ideation to LGBTQ-specific crisis services, a mental health professional, and someone they know who also identifies as LGBTQ. They reported lowest suicide-related disclosure intentions to family, spiritual counselors, and emergency room personnel. Greater lifetime minority stress was significantly associated with lower suicide-related disclosure intentions. When specific domains of minority stress were examined separately, five domains were significantly associated with lower suicide-related disclosure intentions: identity management, family rejection, homonegative communication, negative expectancies, and internalized homonegativity. However, only internalized homonegativity remained significant when they were examined simultaneously. In addition, greater lifetime minority stress was significantly associated with lower suicide-related disclosure intentions to some groups (e.g., family, friends), but not others (e.g., others who have thought about or attempted suicide, others who identify as LGBT). Conclusions: Minority stress may play an important role in LGBTQ + youth’s suicide-related disclosure intentions. As such, reducing minority stress and its effects may be an important target to promote disclosure of suicidal thoughts and access to treatment among LGBTQ + youth.HIGHLIGHTS Minority stress was associated with lower suicide-related disclosure intentions. Internalized homonegativity was uniquely associated with disclosure intentions. Reducing minority stress may promote disclosure of suicidal thoughts.

AB  - Participation in sport is often assumed to promote the healthy development of youth. However, research suggests that gender and sexuality policing in sports negatively impacts the self-esteem of LGBTQ + youth. Using moderated mediation analyses, findings suggest that hyper-surveillance and policing of sexual and gender norms, specifically masculinity, through the use of anti-LGBTQ + language in sport not only marginalizes LGBTQ + individuals, but can harm all youth. Among straight cisgender youth, the conditional direct effect of playing sports on self-esteem was positive for only girls, across race, indicating a positive moderated mediation for girls. The positive effect of playing sports on self-esteem had a comparatively lower effect for white boys, when mediated by the frequency of hearing anti-LGBTQ + language. Implications are discussed.

AB  - The present study was designed to identify social support classes across time among midlife (40-64 years) and older (65+ years) gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), and whether social support protects against depressive symptoms in this population. This study applied longitudinal latent class analysis across five visits on 1,329 individuals age 40 or older at baseline using data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) Healthy Aging substudy collected from April 2016 to October 2018. We identified four classes of social support across time: Partner-centered, that is, high levels of support from one's primary partner(s) and moderate support from friends and family; Friend-centered, that is, high levels of support from friends and chosen family; Low, that is, low levels of support from all sources; and Robust, that is, high levels of support from all sources. We found differences in class membership by age, race/ethnicity, employment status, sexual identity, education, relationship status, and HIV status. Finally, compared to MSM in the low support class, men in the other classes had lower odds of depressive symptoms at the final visit. The most common type of social support was partner-centered, while the least common type was robust. These findings suggest that the presence of any social support, regardless of the source, protects against depressive symptoms.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to describe disrespectful, inadequate, and abusive care to seriously ill patients who identify as transgender and their partners. Methods A cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted. The sample included 865 nurses, physicians, social workers, and chaplains. Respondents were asked whether they had observed disrespectful, inadequate, or abusive care due to the patient being transgender and to describe such care. Results Of the 21.3% of participants who reported observing discriminatory care to a transgender patient, 85.3% had observed disrespectful care, 35.9% inadequate care, and 10.3% abusive care. Disrespectful care included insensitivity; rudeness, ridicule, and gossip by staff; not acknowledging or accepting the patient's gender identity or expression; privacy violations; misgendering; and using the incorrect name. Inadequate care included denying, delaying, or rushing care; ignorance of appropriate medical and other care; and marginalizing or ignoring the spouse/partner. Significance of results These findings illustrate discrimination faced by seriously ill transgender patients and their spouse/partners. Providers who are disrespectful may also deliver inadequate care to transgender patients, which may result in mistrust of providers and the health-care system. Inadequate care due to a patient's or spouse's/partner's gender identity is particularly serious. Dismissing spouses/partners as decision-makers or conferring with biological family members against the patient's wishes may result in unwanted care and constitute a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) violation. Institutional policies and practices should be assessed to determine the degree to which they are affirming to both patients and staff, and revised if needed. Federal and state civil rights legislation protecting the LGBTQ+ community are needed, particularly given the rampant transphobic legislation and the majority of states lacking civil rights laws protecting LGBTQ+ people. Training healthcare professionals and staff to become competent and comfortable treating transgender patients is critical to providing optimal care for these seriously ill patients and their spouse/partner.

AB  - Despite advancements in HIV prevention, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), there remain inequities in accessing PrEP among Black and Hispanic/Latinx cisgender sexual minority men and transgender women (SMMTW). Researchers have documented multiple barriers to PrEP uptake, yet the relative impacts of PrEP internalized stigma and logistical barriers (e.g., Cost; time) to PrEP use are understudied. It may be meaningful to investigate potential interactions between internalized stigma and logistical barriers to PrEP use. We utilized data from 827 Black and Hispanic/Latinx SMMTW (M age = 25.09) in the US and found that greater PrEP-related internalized stigma and greater PrEP logistical barriers were independently significantly associated with lower likelihood of current PrEP use, but PrEP-related internalized stigma became a non-significant predictor when included in a multivariable model. We found a significant interaction between PrEP-related internalized stigma and logistical barriers to PrEP use, such that the association between internalized stigma and likelihood of current PrEP use was only significant at lower levels of logistical barriers to PrEP use. Findings highlight the need to reduce logistical barriers to PrEP use, and for clinicians to acknowledge the role of stigma for individuals who otherwise do not report logistical barriers.

AB  - Understanding hydrologic connectivity within landscapes is crucial for managing environmental challenges. Despite advancements in high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, accurately delineating hydrologic connectivity remains challenging due to disruptions caused by virtual flow barriers, such as roads and bridges. This study addresses this issue by enhancing the detection performance and reducing the latency of Transformer models for image detection of drainage crossings. We retrained a Detection Transformer (DETR) with a specialized recipe to improve culvert detection performance. Owing to the high susceptibility of LiDAR-based DEMs to measurement noise and varying data modalities, we conducted extensive data preprocessing to ensure DETR compatibility with the culvert dataset. Ablation studies on input size indicate that the model performs optimally with 800×800 pixel inputs, demonstrating its adaptability to new data modalities. Additionally, we employed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to decrease the model's latency. We developed a novel strategy to optimize TPU architecture, utilizing genetic algorithms to expedite the discovery of optimal TPU configurations for detection deployment. Our model surpasses the performance of previous models on the same task. This work not only addresses the computational complexities of deploying advanced object detection in environmental contexts but also significantly contributes to the precise and efficient monitoring of hydrologic connectivity.

AB  - Despite improvements in the awareness and acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender diverse (LGBTQ+) individuals, the LGBTQ+ community continues to experience discrimination, which can result in adverse health outcomes. In particular, LGBTQ+ youth have an increased risk of experiencing depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Societal stigma and rejection, bullying, and familial disapproval all contribute to these health disparities. In recognition of these inequities, an interprofessional team of biomedical faculty members, staff, and trainees from the Louisiana State University Health Science Center (LSUHSC) in New Orleans developed the needs-assessment evaluation, the Gender and Sexual Minority Youth Outreach Survey (GSMYO) for high school students. Health science centers have access to resources and experienced personnel who can provide support and education to high school students, teachers, and administrative staff. However, it is important to first determine the high schools’ specific needs, attitudes towards LGBTQ+ acceptance, and their current resources. Faculty, staff, and trainees from the LSUHSC Science Youth Initiative (SYI) and the LSUHSC LGBTQ+ Organization, Tiger Pride, administered the short, anonymous survey to adolescents attending Southeast Louisiana high schools. English Language Learner (ELL) students received the survey in Spanish. Results from the GSMYO needs-assessment survey are presented. Other health science centers may adapt the presented survey to develop needs-based LGBTQ+ high school programs to address the educational and health inequities in their own communities, regardless of location or demographic region.

AB  - Background: Leadership of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia created the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee in 2018 to prioritize diversity work. The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia-Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee implemented a baseline survey of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership in 2020 to assess demographics, equity in leadership, inclusivity, and attitudes toward diversity work. The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia plays a significant role in shaping the future of pediatric anesthesiology and in supporting our diverse pediatric patients. Methods: This study is an IRB-exempt, cross-sectional survey of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership. Quantitative analysis provided descriptive statistics of demographics, practice characteristics, and involvement within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. Qualitative thematic analysis provided an in-depth assessment of perceptions of diversity, challenges faced, and prioritization of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. Results: Out of 3 242 Society for Pediatric Anesthesia members, 1 232 completed the survey representing 38% of overall membership. Respondents were 89.2% United States members, 52.7% female, 55.7% non-Hispanic White, 88.6% heterosexual, 95.7% non-military, 59.2% religious, and 2.1% have an Americans with Disabilities Act recognized disability. All major United States geographical areas were represented equally with 71% practicing in urban areas and 67% in academic settings. Ethnic/racial minorities were more likely to be international medical graduates (p <.001). Among United States members, 41.5% report being fluent in a language other than English, and 23.5% of those fluent in another language are certified to interpret. Compared to men, women are less likely to be in leadership roles (p <.003), but we found no difference in participation and leadership when stratified by race/ethnicity, geography, international medical graduate status, or sexuality. Racial/ethnic minorities (p <.028), women (p <.001), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer members (p <.044) more frequently hold lower academic rank positions when compared to white, heterosexual, and male members. Half of respondents were unsure whether diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges existed within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia while the other half demonstrated opposing views. Among those who reported diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges, the themes centered around persistent marginalization, the need for more inclusive policies and increased psychological safety, and lack of leadership diversity. Conclusions: Compared to the diversity of the pediatric population we serve, there are still significant gaps in demographic representation within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. As well, there is no consensus among Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership regarding perceptions of diversity, equity, and inclusion in pediatric anesthesia in the United States. Among those who reported diversity challenges, opportunities for the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and Anesthesiology Departments to better support minoritized members included bolstering workforce diversity efforts and awareness via more inclusive policies, improved psychological safety, and increasing diversity in leadership. If pediatric anesthesiology is like other specialties, gaining consensus and improving diversity in the workforce might advance pediatric anesthesia innovation, quality, and safety for children of all backgrounds in the United States.

AB  - Objectives: Advance care planning (ACP) specifies decision-making surrogates and preferences for serious illness or end-of-life medical care. ACP research has largely neglected sexual minority men (SMM), a population that experiences disparities in health care and health status. Methods: We examined formal and informal ACP among SMM ages 40+ in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (N = 1,071). Results: For informal ACP (50%), younger SMM and men with past cardiovascular events had greater odds of planning; single men had lower odds of planning. For formal ACP (39%), SMM with greater socioeconomic status had greater odds of planning; SMM who were younger, of racial/ethnic minority identities, who were single or in a relationship without legal protections, and who lacked a primary care home had lower odds of planning. Discussion: Findings warrant further exploration of both informal and formal planning. More equitable, culturally-humble engagement of SMM may facilitate access, uptake, and person-centered planning.

AB  - The exponential growth of astronomical literature poses significant challenges for researchers navigating and synthesizing general insights or even domain-specific knowledge. We present pathfinder, a machine learning framework designed to enable literature review and knowledge discovery in astronomy, focusing on semantic searching with natural language instead of syntactic searches with keywords. Utilizing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and a corpus of 385,166 peer-reviewed papers from the Astrophysics Data System, pathfinder offers an innovative approach to scientific inquiry and literature exploration. Our framework couples advanced retrieval techniques with LLM-based synthesis to search astronomical literature by semantic context as a complement to currently existing methods that use keywords or citation graphs. It addresses complexities of jargon, named entities, and temporal aspects through time-based and citation-based weighting schemes. We demonstrate the tool’s versatility through case studies, showcasing its application in various research scenarios. The system’s performance is evaluated using custom benchmarks, including single-paper and multipaper tasks. Beyond literature review, pathfinder offers unique capabilities for reformatting answers in ways that are accessible to various audiences (e.g., in a different language or as simplified text), visualizing research landscapes, and tracking the impact of observatories and methodologies. This tool represents a significant advancement in applying artificial intelligence to astronomical research, aiding researchers at all career stages in navigating modern astronomy literature.

AB  - Introduction: The layered learning model (LLM) is a well-established teaching approach designed for attending preceptors to train post-graduate learners and to precept students. The adaptation of a LLM to a virtual exchange program has not been previously described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the longitudinal virtual international exchange program in applying principles of the LLM to multiple levels of learners and instructors at West Virginia University (WVU) School of Pharmacy and Kitasato University (KU) School of Pharmacy. Methods: The online survey piloted the impact of applying the LLM to virtual international exchange sessions on improving participant knowledge in pharmacy practice, pharmacy education, cultural practices, and cultural awareness. The survey questions assessed the program's structure and effectiveness in achieving learning outcomes related to pharmacy residency topics and cultural competency using a five-point Likert scale. Results: Median scores of the effectiveness of the virtual international exchange program structure were high (≥ 4.0). Two questions evaluating the use of the LLM had median scores of 4.0. All nine residency-related questions were rated ≥3.0. The median scores for three questions evaluating small group discussions and the use of the LLM were rated significantly higher by WVU participants than KU participants. There were no significant differences in program structure and learning outcome ratings between participant groups (student vs. resident/fellow vs. preceptor/faculty). Conclusions: Application of the LLM to the virtual international exchange program was positively received by participants, particularly by United States participants.

AB  - This study describes multifactorial discrimination (discrimination attributed to multiple social identities) among middle-aged and older adult MSM. MSM aged 40+ years (N = 1,193) enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study completed behavioral surveys ascertaining experiences of discrimination and their social identity attributions. Non-proportional odds regressions assessed multifactorial discrimination by age, race/ethnicity, HIV status, and covariates. Twenty-seven percent of participants reported multifactorial discrimination. Adjusted models indicated that middle-aged men were more likely to report multifactorial discrimination compared to older adult men. Racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to report multifactorial discrimination compared to non-Hispanic white participants. These same patterns emerged among the sub-sample of participants living with HIV. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of multifactorial discrimination in middle-aged and older MSM. Our findings support the deleterious association between multiple-marginalization and multifactorial discrimination. Multilevel interventions targeting interconnected experiences of stigma may improve the health of MSM in transition to older age.

AB  - Objectives: We sought to test whether discrimination salience and multifactorial discrimination were associated with prevalent experiences of internalized homophobia among middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: We analyzed data from 498 middle-aged and older MSM from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) who reported any lifetime discrimination experience. We estimated the prevalence ratio of current internalized homophobia using multivariable Poisson regressions, accounting for discrimination salience, multifactorial discrimination, and covariates. We then assessed whether multifactorial discrimination moderated the association between discrimination salience and internalized homophobia. Results: Over half (56.4%) of our sample reported any current experience of internalized homophobia. More than two-thirds reported multifactorial discrimination (68.2%) and more than one-third (36.7%) reported moderate-to-high discrimination salience. Increases in discrimination salience (PR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20) were associated with any current internalized homophobia among middle-aged and older MSM. Multifactorial discrimination was not statistically associated with internalized homophobia and did not moderate the association between discrimination salience and internalized homophobia. Conclusions: Our study underscores internalized homophobia as a persisting concern among MSM in midlife and older adulthood. Our findings suggest that salience, as a characteristic of discrimination experiences, may have a greater impact on internalized homophobia compared with exposure. Future research efforts should assess facets of discrimination salience, such as severity, frequency, and chronicity, to better understand how discrimination shapes psychosocial well-being across the life course. Mental health advocates at policy, organizational, and community levels should aim to reduce intersectional stigma and address individual experiences of internalized homophobia.

AB  - The various forms of HIV-related stigma continue to serve as major barriers to HIV care and treatment among men who have sex with men (MSM). The study of resilience within the context of HIV-related stigma among MSM living with HIV represents a promising area of research to inform the development of future HIV interventions for this population. We examined resilience within the context of HIV related stigma among MSM living with HIV in Louisiana with a particular interest in how resilience may be more relevant for Black MSM. We utilized Pearson’s correlations and layered chi-square non-parametric tests to examine associations and racial differences in resilience, four HIV-related stigma measures/consequences (i.e., anticipated, internalized, enacted, and consequences of enacted HIV stigma), and HIV care outcomes (i.e., length of time since last HIV care visit, time since last HIV lab result, most recent HIV viral load result) among 110 MSM living with HIV in Louisiana who participated in the Louisiana HIV Stigma Index Project. The majority of MSM participants were Black (75%), lived in New Orleans (52%), and reported limited education (52%) and income (76%). MSM who reported higher levels of enacted HIV stigma, consequences of enacted HIV stigma, and internalized HIV stigma reported poorer HIV care outcomes. Both internalized and anticipated HIV stigma significantly negatively impacted Black MSM perceptions of their overall health compared with White MSM. Compared with White MSM, Black MSM who reported greater consequences of enacted HIV stigma had poorer HIV care outcomes. Resilience was associated with positive HIV care outcomes for both Black and White MSM. However, having higher levels of resilience may have been more protective for Black MSM such that higher levels of resilience were associated with less time since last HIV care visit for Black MSM than for White MSM. The current study provides preliminary information on the potential positive relationship between resilience and HIV care outcomes among MSM, particularly Black MSM. However, these findings need to be confirmed among a more representative sample of Black and White MSM in Louisiana.

AB  - The deadliest anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) often transforms from indolent differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC); however, the complex intratumor transformation process is poorly understood. We investigated an anaplastic transformation model by dissecting both cell lineage and cell fate transitions using single-cell transcriptomic and genetic alteration data from patients with different subtypes of thyroid cancer. The resulting spectrum of ATC transformation included stress-responsive DTC cells, inflammatory ATC cells (iATCs), and mitotic-defective ATC cells and extended all the way to mesenchymal ATC cells (mATCs). Furthermore, our analysis identified 2 important milestones: (a) a diploid stage, in which iATC cells were diploids with inflammatory phenotypes and (b) an aneuploid stage, in which mATCs gained aneuploid genomes and mesenchymal phenotypes, producing excessive amounts of collagen and collagen-interacting receptors. In parallel, cancer-associated fibroblasts showed strong interactions among mesenchymal cell types, macrophages shifted from M1 to M2 states, and T cells reprogrammed from cytotoxic to exhausted states, highlighting new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of ATC.

We also used linear mixed-effects models to estimate the association between baseline social support and cognitive function across four subsequent time points. We evaluated a multiplicative interaction term between baseline social support and time, in order to determine whether cognitive trajectories over time vary by baseline social support.Results:Social support was associated with lower TMT Part A scores at baseline and over the subsequent 2 years, indicating better psychomotor ability. Social support was associated with higher SDMT scores at baseline and across 2 years, indicating better information processing. We observed no association between social support and TMT B to A ratio at baseline or across 2 years, indicating no effect on set-shifting ability. Longitudinal cognition outcome trajectories did not vary by the level of baseline social support.Conclusion:Social support and cognitive function were associated in this sample over a short time period. Further research should explore causal relationships over the lifespan.

AB  - Purpose: We investigated the relation between adversities in early adolescence and risk of a depressive phenotype in adulthood, and whether stress in adulthood modified these associations. Methods: A total of 1138 men who have sex with men (MSM) participated in a Multicenter AIDS Cohort substudy in which they reported on adversities in early adolescence. Poisson regression estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) for associations between adversities and a depressive phenotype in adulthood. Stratified analyses examined the effects of stress in the last year on the depressive phenotype. Results: In adjusted models, men who were verbally insulted; threatened by physical violence; had an object thrown at them; or punched, kicked, or beaten were at higher risk of having a depressive phenotype in adulthood (for ≥1 time per month vs. never, PR = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.96; PR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.45-2.34; PR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.51-2.66; or PR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.35-2.34, respectively.) Being threatened with a weapon approached statistical significance (PR = 1.89, 95% CI = 0.96-3.72). Although higher stress was associated with depression overall, early adolescent victimization was only associated with depression among MSM not reporting high levels of stress in the last year (for ≥1 time per month vs. never, PR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.09-2.59; PR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.40-3.17; PR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.24-4.03; PR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.22-3.22, respectively). Conclusion: The attenuation of relationships between adversities and depression among men reporting high stress may suggest that adult stress overshadows long-term effects of early adolescent victimization on adult depression. Victimization in early adolescence may increase the risk of sustained depressive symptoms in mid- to later life, reinforcing the need for preventive strategies.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Disparities in medical student membership in Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) are well documented. Less is known about Gold Humanism Honor Society (GHHS) membership and it remains unknown how the intersection of different identities is associated with membership in these honor societies. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between honor society membership and medical student race and ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersection of identities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed data from Association of American Medical Colleges data collection instruments. The study included all students who graduated from Liaison Committee on Medical Education–accredited US medical schools from 2016 to 2019 and completed the Graduation Questionnaire. Data analysis was conducted from January 12 to July 12, 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Likelihood of AOA and GHHS membership by student race and ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, childhood family income, and intersection of identities. RESULTS The sample of 50 384 individuals comprised 82 (0.2%) American Indian or Alaska Native, 10 601 (21.0%) Asian, 2464 (4.9%) Black, 3291 (6.5%) Hispanic, 25 (0.1%) Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 30 610 (60.8%) White, 2476 (4.9%) multiracial students, and 834 (1.7%) students of other races or ethnicities. Sex and sexual orientation included 25 672 (51.0%) men and 3078 (6.1%) lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB). Childhood family income comprised 31 758 (60.0%) individuals with $75 000 per year or greater, 8160 (16.2%) with $50 000 to $74 999 per year, 6864 (13.6%) with $25 000 to $49 999 per year, and 3612 (7.2%) with less than $25 000 per year. The sample included 7303 (14.5%) AOA members only, 4925 (9.8%) GHHS members only, and 2384 (4.7%) members of both societies. In AOA, American Indian or Alaska Native (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.96), Asian (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.45-0.53), Black (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.20-0.30), Hispanic (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.47-0.59), multiracial (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.77), and other race and ethnicity (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.88) were underrepresented compared with White students; LGB students (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.83) were underrepresented compared with heterosexual students; and childhood family income $50 000 to $74 999 (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.86), $25 000 to $49 999 (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.62-0.74), and less than $25 000 (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53-0.69) were underrepresented compared with greater than or equal to $75 000. In GHHS, Asian students (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.87) were underrepresented compared with White students, female students (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.45-1.65) were overrepresented compared with male students, LGB students (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.23-1.51) were overrepresented compared with heterosexual students, and students with childhood family income $25 000 to $49 999 (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94) and less than $25 000 (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66-0.86) were underrepresented compared with those with greater than or equal to $75 000. Likelihood of AOA, but not GHHS, membership decreased as number of marginalized identities increased. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study of US medical students, membership disparities were noted in both AOA and GHHS. However, differences in GHHS existed across fewer identities, sometimes favored the marginalized group, and were not cumulative.

AB  - Objective: Syndemic conditions have been linked to engagement in receptive condomless anal sex (CAS) and HIV seroconversion. However, little is known about the biological pathways whereby syndemics could amplify vulnerability to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Design: HIV-negative sexual minority men (i.e. gay, bisexual and other MSM) were recruited from four STI clinics in South Florida for a cross-sectional study. Methods: Participants completed assessments for four syndemic conditions: depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, hazardous alcohol use and any stimulant use (i.e. any self-reported use or reactive urine toxicology results). Cytokine and chemokine levels were measured using LEGENDplex from the rectal swabs of 92 participants reporting receptive CAS and no antibiotic use in the past three months. Results: After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and number of receptive CAS partners, a greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher levels of rectal cytokines/chemokines relevant to immune activation, inflammation and the expansion and maintenance of T-helper 17 target cells, including rectal interferon-gamma (β = 0.22; P = 0.047), CXCL-8 (β = 0.24; P = 0.025) and interleukin-23 (β = 0.22; P = 0.049). Elevations in rectal cytokine or chemokine levels were most pronounced among participants experiencing two or more syndemic conditions compared with those experiencing no syndemic conditions. PrEP use was independently associated with elevations in multiple rectal cytokines/chemokines. Conclusion: Syndemic conditions could increase biological vulnerability to HIV and other STIs in sexual minority men by potentiating rectal immune dysregulation.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effects of polyethylene glycol loxenatide (PEG-Loxe), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on a three-point major adverse cardiovascular event (3P-MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study was conducted in six tertiary hospitals in three cities in China. Large language models were used to retrospectively screen and include 12,341 patients with T2DM who had either cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors. The patients were divided into the PEG-Loxe cohort (treated with PEG-Loxe, n = 1282) and the control cohort (treated with incretin glucose-lowering agents, n = 11,059). After a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 3P-MACE occurred in 51 (4.0%) and 1263 (11.4%) patients in PEG-Loxe and control cohorts, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49–0.94; p = 0.019). In the PEG-Loxe versus control cohorts, 21 (1.6%) versus 476 (4.3%) patients experienced nonfatal stroke (HR 0.63; p = 0.041), whereas 22 (1.7%) versus 545 (4.9%) experienced nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR 0.66; p = 0.058), and the incidence of cardiovascular death was 8 (0.6%) versus 240 (2.2%), respectively (HR 0.56; p = 0.118). We found a significantly lower incidence of first nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular deaths in the PEG-Loxe cohort than the control cohort.

AB  - Discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons in health care creates barriers to serious illness care, including patients avoiding or delaying necessary care, providers disrespecting wishes of surrogates, and adverse outcomes for patients and families. A cross-sectional mixed-methods study using an online survey was used to determine the extent to which LGBTQ+ patients and spouses, partners, and widows experienced disrespectful or inadequate care due to sexual orientation or gender identity. A total of 290 LGBTQ+ patients and partners reported high levels of disrespectful and inadequate care, including 35.2% stating their provider was insensitive to them because of their identity; 30% reporting their provider was unaware of LGBTQ+ health needs; 23.1% feeling judged; 20.7% experiencing rudeness; 20.3% stating providers did not use their correct pronouns; and 19.7% reporting their treatment decisions were disregarded. Black and Hispanic patients were 2–4 times more likely than non-Hispanic White patients to report discrimination. This study demonstrated high levels of disrespectful and inadequate care towards patients and partners due to being LGBTQ+, which was especially problematic for Black and Hispanic patients and those living in politically conservative regions. Recommendations include federal and state civil rights laws to prohibit LGBTQ+ discrimination and institutional practices to address discrimination, including cultural sensitivity training for staff.

AB  - Effective classification of autonomous vehicle (AV) driving behavior emerges as a critical area for diagnosing AV operation faults, enhancing autonomous driving algorithms, and reducing accident rates. This paper presents the Gramian Angular Field Vision Transformer (GAF-ViT) model, specifically designed for analyzing AV driving behavior. The GAF-ViT model is developed upon a novel integration of three key components: GAF Transformation Module, which transforms multivariate driving behavior representative sequences into multi-channel images; Channel Attention Module, which prioritizes relevant behavioral features to enhance classification effectiveness; and Multi-Channel ViT Module, which employs advanced image recognition techniques to accurately classify the resulting multi-channel driving behavior images. This framework not only facilitates detailed analysis of complex multivariate driving behavioral data but also leverages the capabilities of vision-based pattern recognition methods to uncover subtle driving behavior nuances. Experimental evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset of trajectories demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, an ablation study effectively validates the efficacy of individual modules within the model.

AB  - Background: Black cisgender gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority men (SMM) and transgender women (TW) continue to be heavily affected by HIV. Further research is needed to better understand HIV prevention and care outcomes in this population. In particular, there is a need for research examining the impact of substance use and sleep health on HIV prevention and treatment outcomes among Black SMM and TW. Objective: This paper outlines the study methods being used in the recently launched follow-up study to the Neighborhoods and Networks (N2) study, which we refer to as N2 Part 2 (N2P2). N2P2 aims to address this gap in the literature, build off the findings of the original N2 study, and identify socioenvironmental determinants of health, including whether neighborhood and network factors mediate and moderate these relationships. Methods: Building on the N2 cohort study in Chicago from 2018 to 2022, N2P2 used a prospective longitudinal cohort design and an observational-implementation hybrid approach. With sustained high levels of community engagement, we aim to recruit a new sample of 600 Black SMM and TW participants residing in the Chicago metropolitan statistical area. Participants are asked to participate in 3 study visits across an 18-month study period (1 visit every 9 months). Four different forms of data are collected per wave: (1) an in-person survey, (2) biological specimen collection, (3) a daily remote ecological momentary assessment for 14 days after each study visit, and (4) data from electronic health records. These forms of data collection continue to assess neighborhood and network factors and specifically explore substance use, sleep, immune function, obesity, and the implementation of potential interventions that address relevant constructs (eg, alcohol use and pre-exposure prophylaxis adherence). Results: The N2P2 study was funded in August 2021 by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (R01DA054553 and R21DA053156) and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (R01HL160325). This study was launched in November 2022. Recruitment and enrollment for the first wave of data collection are currently ongoing. Conclusions: The N2P2 study is applying innovative methods to comprehensively explore the impacts of substance use and sleep health on HIV-related outcomes among an HIV status–neutral cohort of Black SMM and TW in Chicago. This study is applying an observational-implementation hybrid design to help us achieve findings that support rapid translation, a critical priority among populations such as Black SMM and TW that experience long-standing inequities with regard to HIV and other health-related outcomes. N2P2 will directly build off the findings that have resulted from the original N2 study among Black SMM and TW in Chicago. These findings provide a better understanding of multilevel (eg, individual, network, and neighborhood) factors that contribute to HIV-related outcomes and viral suppression among Black SMM and TW.

AB  - Li+/Na+ exchange has been extensively explored as an effective method to prepare high-performance Mn-based layered cathodes for Li-ion batteries, since the first report in 1996 by P. G. Bruce (Nature, 1996. 381, 499–500). Understanding the detailed structural changes during the ion-exchange process is crucial to implement the synthetic control of high-performance layered Mn-based cathodes, but less studied. Herein, in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, density functional theory calculations, and electrochemical tests are combined to conduct the systemic studies into the structural changes during the ion-exchange process of an Mn-only layered cathode O3-type Li0.67[Li0.22Mn0.78]O2 (LLMO) from the corresponding counterpart P3-type Na0.67[Li0.22Mn0.78]O2 (NLMO). The temperature-resolved observations combined with theoretical calculations reveal that the Li+/Na+ exchange is favorable thermodynamically and composited with two tandem topotactic phase transitions: 1) from NLMO to a layered intermediate through ≈60% of Li+/Na+ exchange. 2) then to the final layered product LLMO through further Li insertion. Moreover, the intermediate-dominate composite is obtained by slowing down the exchange kinetics below room temperature, showing better electrochemical performance than LLMO obtained by the traditional molten-salt method. The findings provide guides for the synthetic control of high-performance Mn-based cathodes under mild conditions.

AB  - Background: Vanadium (V) is an element with a wide range of effects on the mammalian organism. The ability of this metal to form organometallic compounds has contributed to the increase in the number of studies on the multidirectional biological activity of its various organic complexes in view of their application in medicine. Objective: This review aims at summarizing the current state of knowledge of the pharmacological potential of V and the mechanisms underlying its anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-hypercholesterolemic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective activity as well as the mechanisms of appetite regulation related to the possibility of using this element in the treatment of obesity. The toxicological potential of V and the mechanisms of its toxic action, which have not been sufficiently recognized yet, as well as key information about the essentiality of this metal, its physiological role, and metabolism with certain aspects on the timeline is collected as well. The report also aims to review the use of V in the implantology and industrial sectors emphasizing the human health hazard as well as collect data on the directions of further research on V and its interactions with Mg along with their character. Results and Conclusions: Multidirectional studies on V have shown that further analyses are still required for this element to be used as a metallodrug in the fight against certain life-threatening diseases. Studies on interactions of V with Mg, which showed that both elements are able to modulate the response in an interactive manner are needed as well, as the results of such investigations may help not only in recognizing new markers of V toxicity and clarify the underlying interactive mechanism between them, thus improving the medical application of the metals against modern-age diseases, but also they may help in development of principles of effective protection of humans against environmental/occupational V exposure.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly improve the delivery of healthcare and other services that advance population health and wellbeing. However, the use of AI in healthcare also brings potential risks that may cause unintended harm. To guide future developments in AI, the High-Level Expert Group on AI set up by the European Commission (EC), recently published ethics guidelines for what it terms “trustworthy” AI. These guidelines are aimed at a variety of stakeholders, especially guiding practitioners toward more ethical and more robust applications of AI. In line with efforts of the EC, AI ethics scholarship focuses increasingly on converting abstract principles into actionable recommendations. However, the interpretation, relevance, and implementation of trustworthy AI depend on the domain and the context in which the AI system is used. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how to use the general AI HLEG trustworthy AI guidelines in practice in the healthcare domain. To this end, we present a best practice of assessing the use of machine learning as a supportive tool to recognize cardiac arrest in emergency calls. The AI system under assessment is currently in use in the city of Copenhagen in Denmark. The assessment is accomplished by an independent team composed of philosophers, policy makers, social scientists, technical, legal, and medical experts. By leveraging an interdisciplinary team, we aim to expose the complex trade-offs and the necessity for such thorough human review when tackling socio-technical applications of AI in healthcare. For the assessment, we use a process to assess trustworthy AI, called 1Z-Inspection® to identify specific challenges and potential ethical trade-offs when we consider AI in practice.

AB  - Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is a neurodegenerative entity defined as Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary degeneration primarily affecting the medial temporal lobe with minimal to absent amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition. The extent to which PART can be differentiated pathoanatomically from Alzheimer disease (AD) is unclear. Here, we examined the regional distribution of tau pathology in a large cohort of postmortem brains (n = 914). We found an early vulnerability of the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus to neurofibrillary degeneration in PART, and semiquantitative assessment of neurofibrillary degeneration in CA2 was significantly greater than in CA1 in PART. In contrast, subjects harboring intermediate-to-high AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) displayed relative sparing of CA2 until later stages of their disease course. In addition, the CA2/CA1 ratio of neurofibrillary degeneration in PART was significantly higher than in subjects with intermediate-to-high ADNC burden. Furthermore, the distribution of tau pathology in PART diverges from the Braak NFT staging system and Braak stage does not correlate with cognitive function in PART as it does in individuals with intermediate-to-high ADNC. These findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the contribution of PART to cognitive impairment and how neurofibrillary degeneration interacts with Aβ pathology in AD and PART.

AB  - Background: Measuring routine childhood vaccination is crucial to inform global vaccine policies and programme implementation, and to track progress towards targets set by the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) and Immunization Agenda 2030. Robust estimates of routine vaccine coverage are needed to identify past successes and persistent vulnerabilities. Drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020, Release 1, we did a systematic analysis of global, regional, and national vaccine coverage trends using a statistical framework, by vaccine and over time. Methods: For this analysis we collated 55 326 country-specific, cohort-specific, year-specific, vaccine-specific, and dose-specific observations of routine childhood vaccination coverage between 1980 and 2019. Using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, we produced location-specific and year-specific estimates of 11 routine childhood vaccine coverage indicators for 204 countries and territories from 1980 to 2019, adjusting for biases in country-reported data and reflecting reported stockouts and supply disruptions. We analysed global and regional trends in coverage and numbers of zero-dose children (defined as those who never received a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis [DTP] vaccine dose), progress towards GVAP targets, and the relationship between vaccine coverage and sociodemographic development. Findings: By 2019, global coverage of third-dose DTP (DTP3; 81·6% [95% uncertainty interval 80·4–82·7]) more than doubled from levels estimated in 1980 (39·9% [37·5–42·1]), as did global coverage of the first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1; from 38·5% [35·4–41·3] in 1980 to 83·6% [82·3–84·8] in 2019). Third-dose polio vaccine (Pol3) coverage also increased, from 42·6% (41·4–44·1) in 1980 to 79·8% (78·4–81·1) in 2019, and global coverage of newer vaccines increased rapidly between 2000 and 2019. The global number of zero-dose children fell by nearly 75% between 1980 and 2019, from 56·8 million (52·6–60·9) to 14·5 million (13·4–15·9). However, over the past decade, global vaccine coverage broadly plateaued; 94 countries and territories recorded decreasing DTP3 coverage since 2010. Only 11 countries and territories were estimated to have reached the national GVAP target of at least 90% coverage for all assessed vaccines in 2019. Interpretation: After achieving large gains in childhood vaccine coverage worldwide, in much of the world this progress was stalled or reversed from 2010 to 2019. These findings underscore the importance of revisiting routine immunisation strategies and programmatic approaches, recentring service delivery around equity and underserved populations. Strengthening vaccine data and monitoring systems is crucial to these pursuits, now and through to 2030, to ensure that all children have access to, and can benefit from, lifesaving vaccines.
