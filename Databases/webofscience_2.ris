AB  - Intent classification is a foundational element in natural language processing, enabling conversational systems to accurately interpret user intent. In educational contexts, effective intent classification within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) can significantly enhance personalized student interactions. This paper presents the intent classification module for the Learner-Aware AI (LAAI) tutor, a dialogue-based ITS designed to recognize and respond to diverse student behaviors, such as valid answers, questions, expressions of boredom, and requests for clarification. We introduce LAAIIntentD, a custom data set specifically designed for this task, containing 1,244 labeled training records and 278 evaluation records. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) LAAI-intent-classifier using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to create a lightweight yet powerful intent classifier. Our fine-tuned model achieves better overall Recall (0.86), Precision (0.85), and F1-Score (0.83) compared to GPT-based methods. GPT models with CoT and Few-Shot prompting improve Recall but sacrifice F1 scores. This highlights our model's efficiency in balancing accuracy and scalability for ITS applications.

AB  - Researchers have increasingly utilized artificial intelligence to automatically analyze classroom dialogue, aiming to provide timely feedback to teachers due to its educational significance. However, traditional machine learning and deep learning models face challenges, such as limited performance and lack of generalizability, across various dimensions of classroom dialogue and educational contexts. Recent efforts to utilize large language models (LLMs) for classroom dialogue analysis have predominantly relied on prompt engineering techniques, primarily due to the high costs associated with full fine-tuning, which has resulted in suboptimal performance and areas needing improvement. We, therefore, propose the application of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to enhance the performance of LLMs in classroom dialogue analysis. Specifically, we utilized low-rank adaptation, a prominent PEFT technique, to fine-tune three state-of-the-art LLMs-Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-2-9B, and Mistral-7B-v0.3-targeting the analysis of both teachers' and students' dialogic moves within K-12 mathematics lessons. The experimental results indicate that, in comparison to fully fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa models and prompting LLMs, LLMs fine-tuned using the PEFT technique achieve superior performance. Moreover, the PEFT approach significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters within the LLMs by over 300 times and decreased their training duration. Although the training time for PEFT-tuned LLMs was still longer than that required for fully fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa, these LLMs demonstrated specialization in this specific dimension and generalizability to other tasks and contexts. We believe that the use of PEFT techniques presents a promising direction for future research in classroom dialogue analysis.

AB  - Educators face the continuous challenge of updating their teaching materials with the fast-paced changes in cybersecurity and integrating emerging topics into their existing content. This work presents the development progress of a cybersecurity curriculum fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) designed to assist educators in creating engaging curricular materials for introductory cybersecurity topics. Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the increased number of openly available LLMs like OpenAI's GPT and Meta's Llama present an opportunity to fine-tune these models for specific domains like cybersecurity. The fine-tuned LLMs offer a potential solution by reducing the amount of work necessary to regularly update curricular content, including lab assignments, assessments, in-class activities, and other additional resources for both synchronous and asynchronous classrooms.

AB  - Automatic detection of prerequisite relations between concepts in education has always been a challenging AI task for researchers. Identification of prerequisite relations enables students to study new subjects more effectively and systematically, while allowing instructors to better tailor their learning materials to students' needs. However, to accurately detect these relations, the AI system must understand the context and meaning behind each concept and how it relates to other concepts in the domain. This requires a deep understanding of the educational curriculum and the ability to analyze large amounts of text and data. Large language models (LLMs) are a recent innovation in AI. LLMs have the capability to understand and generate human-like text since they are trained on a vast amount of text from the internet, books, articles, and more. LLMs can also be fine-tuned to specialize in tasks such as document summarization, question answering, or detecting user sentiment in reviews. Fine-tuning is done with a smaller, task-specific dataset. In this work, we introduce strategies for fine-tuning LLMs to improve their capability to detect prerequisite relations between educational concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes fine-tuned LLMs for prerequisite detection. Our evaluation results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs are effective models for prerequisite detection. Our fine-tuning process also facilitates the generation of explanations to shed light on the reasoning behind prerequisite relations. Datasets we generated and used in fine-tuning are made public for the research community. We hope our contributions can aid in organizing and presenting knowledge in education and serve as a foundation for future research in the field.

AB  - Adaptive assessment is challenging, and considering various competence levels and their relations makes it even more complex. Nevertheless, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) provide new means of addressing these relevant issues. In this paper, we introduce BloomLLM, a novel adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically designed to enhance the generation of educational content in alignment with Bloom's Revised Taxonomy. BloomLLM performs well across all levels of competencies by providing meaningful, semantically connected questions. It is achieved by addressing the challenges of foundational LLMs, such as lack of semantic interdependence of levels and increased hallucination, which often result in unrealistic and impractical questions. BloomLLM, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-3.5-turbo, was developed by fine-tuning 1026 questions spanning 29 topics in two master courses during the winter semester 2023. The model's performance, outpacing ChatGPT-4, even with varied prompting strategies, marks a significant advancement in applying generative AI in education. We have publicly made the BloomLLM codes and training datasets available to promote transparency and reproducibility.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being utilized in various fields, and research on generative AI, particularly within natural being conducted. Currently, research related to generative AI in the education sector utilizes closed large language models (LLMs) like GPT. However, these models have limitations, as they are difficult to fine-tune and incur high costs. This study aims to explore the potential educational applications of Open LLMs by fine-tuning and comparing the performance of Llama2 and Polyglot, which are built on a Korean-based model, with Llama3, which is not based on a Korean model. The experimental results, using a question-and-answer dataset from elementary school social studies and science subjects, showed that the Llama2 13B model exhibited the highest performance, followed by the Polyglot 12.8B approximately 93.08% of the performance of the Llama2 13B model and about 98.63% of the performance of the Polyglot 12.8B model. This based models can demonstrate high performance. These results suggest that future development of LLMs base models may omit the process of converting them into language-specific base models. Additionally, fine-tuning Open LLMs for educational applications shows potential for providing personalized education.

AB  - Automatic short answer grading can significantly enhance the speed and fairness of grading, making it particularly valuable in areas with a shortage of teachers, such as Africa [1]. However, for most African languages it is very challenging to build automatic short answer grading systems due to the limited availability of natural language processing corpora. Furthermore, only experts can deal with the complex algorithms, required for training and fine-tuning traditional automatic short answer grading systems. Given that state-of-the-art large language models have the potential to address these problems through their growing capabilities and ease of use through prompting, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot learning, we investigated their performance for grading student answers in the African language Twi. To address the absence of a Twi corpus, we translated and validated the University of North Texas benchmark corpus [2], creating the first Twi automatic short answer grading corpus. On this corpus, we evaluated the performances of the large language models GPT-4o [3], Claude 3 Sonnet [4], and LLaMA 3 [5] as well as for comparison two more traditional approaches: a fine-tuned AfroLM and a cross-lingual M-BERT approach. Among individual models, the cross-lingual M-BERT had the best performance with a mean absolute error of 0.79 points out of 5 points, followed by fine-tuned AfroLM at 0.73 points and Claude 3 Sonnet at 1.00 points. However, combining AfroLM and M-BERT outputs achieved the lowest mean absolute error of 0.64 points, which is less than the human grader variance of 0.75 points in the original corpus [6]. Combining the outputs of the large language models GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, and LLaMA 3, obtained through few-shot learning, yielded a mean absolute error of 1.10 points.

AB  - Automated Essay Scoring (AES) as a classification task is an effective way to categorize essays based on predefined rubrics or score ranges. It focuses on predicting a class label (score or grade) rather than assigning a precise numerical score, offering advantages in simplicity, adaptability, and consistency. Traditionally, LSTM with word embeddings that are trained on large general corpora have been used for the classification task. Domain-tailored word embeddings provide a significant added advantage to capture the specific terminology and semantic relationships relevant to a particular field, domain, or application. Hence, in this study we proposed two approaches: (1) hyper-parameter-tuned Word2Vec embeddings catered to the need of AES system are fed into Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, and (2) fine-tuning a Large Language Model from Meta AI (Llama) on the Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) dataset. The results indicate that hyper parameter tuning helped to generate domain tailored embeddings which significantly improves model accuracy by reducing inconsistencies in essay scoring. Additionally, fine-tuning the Large Language Model's (LLMs) further improves system performance. These results show that the presented approaches significantly helped to outperform the limitations of the methods used in existing literature, leading to higher accuracy in AES system.

AB  - Background: Large language models (LLMs) have the potentialto enhance clinical flow and improve medical education, but they encounter challenges related to specialized knowledge in ophthalmology. Objective: This study aims to enhance ophthalmic knowledge by refining a general LLM into an ophthalmology-specialized assistant for patient inquiries and medical education. Methods: Wetransformed Llama2 into an ophthalmology-specialized LLM, termed EyeGPT, through the following 3 strategies: prompt engineering for role-playing, fine-tuning with publicly available data sets filtered for eye-specific terminology (83,919 samples), and retrieval-augmented generation leveraging a medical database and 14 ophthalmology textbooks. The efficacy of various EyeGPT variants was evaluated by 4 board-certified ophthalmologists through comprehensive use of 120 diversecategory questions in both simple and complex question-answering scenarios. The performance of the best EyeGPT model was then compared with that of the unassisted human physician group and the EyeGPT+human group. We proposed 4 metrics for assessment: accuracy, understandability, trustworthiness, and empathy. The proportion of hallucinations was also reported. Results: The best fine-tuned model significantly outperformed the original Llama2 model at providing informed advice (mean 9.30, SD 4.42 vs mean 13.79, SD 5.70; P <.001) and mitigating hallucinations (97/120, 80.8% vs 53/120, 44.2%, P <.001). Incorporating information retrieval from reliable sources, particularly ophthalmology textbooks, further improved the model's response compared with solely the best fine-tuned model (mean 13.08, SD 5.43 vs mean 15.14, SD 4.64; P =.001) and reduced hallucinations (71/120, 59.2% vs 57/120, 47.4%, P =.02). Subgroup analysis revealed that EyeGPT showed robustness across common diseases, with consistent performance across different users and domains. Among the variants, the model integrating fine-tuning and book retrieval ranked highest, closely followed by the combination of fine-tuning and the manual database, standalone fine-tuning, and pure role-playing methods. EyeGPT demonstrated competitive capabilities in understandability and empathy when compared with human ophthalmologists. With the assistance of EyeGPT, the performance of the ophthalmologist was notably enhanced. Conclusions: We pioneered and introduced EyeGPT by refining a general domain LLM and conducted a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of different strategies to develop an ophthalmology-specific assistant. Our results highlight EyeGPT's potentialto assist ophthalmologists and patients in medical settings.

AB  - After the emergence of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have incorporated LLM into educational contexts. Nevertheless, due to the suboptimal performance of LLM in mathematical computations, the application of math education with the aid of LLM is limited. Meanwhile, as the educational experts indicate that, the students can learn better if diverse solutions are provided. Thus, we propose a methodology that simplifies the LLM to learn through instructional abstraction. By adopting this methodology, the solution diversity is greatly, automatically, and most importantly, accurately generated.

AB  - Due to the widespread applicability of generative artificial intelligence, we have seen it adopted across many areas of education, providing universities with new opportunities, particularly in cybersecurity education. With the industry facing a skills shortage, this paper explores the use of generative artificial intelligence in higher cybersecurity education as an intelligent tutoring system to enhance factors leading to positive student outcomes. Despite its success in content generation and assessment within cybersecurity, the field's multidisciplinary nature presents additional challenges to scalability and generalisability. We propose a solution using agents to orchestrate specialised large language models and to demonstrate its applicability in graduate level cybersecurity topics offered at a leading Australian university. We aim to show a generalisable and scalable solution to diversified educational paradigms, highlighting its relevant features, and a method to evaluate the quality of content as well as the general effectiveness of the intelligent tutoring system on subjective factors aligned with positive student outcomes. We further explore areas for future research in model efficiency, privacy, security, and scalability.

AB  - In 2023, we developed and deployed AI-based tools in CS50 at Harvard University to provide students with 24/7 interactive assistance, approximating a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio. These tools offer code explanations, style suggestions, and responses to course-related inquiries, emulating human educators to foster critical thinking. However, maintaining alignment with instructional goals is challenging, especially with frequent updates to the underlying large language models (LLMs). We thus propose a continuous improvement process for LLM-based systems using a collaborative human-in-the-loop approach. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework for assessing and refining the performance of AI-based tutors, combining human-graded and model-graded evaluations. Using few-shot prompting and fine-tuning, we aim to ensure our AI tools adopt pedagogically sound teaching styles. Fine-tuning with a small, high-quality dataset has shown significant improvements in aligning with teaching goals, as confirmed through multi-turn conversation evaluations. Additionally, our framework includes a model-evaluation backend that teaching assistants periodically review, ensuring the AI system remains effective and aligned with instructional objectives. This paper offers insights into our methods and the impact of these AI tools on CS50 and contributes to the discourse on AI in education, showcasing scalable, personalized learning enhancements.

AB  - Objective Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is an effective measure to prevent and control the diseases caused by HPV. However, widespread misinformation and vaccine hesitancy remain significant barriers to its uptake. This study focuses on the development of VaxBot-HPV, a chatbot aimed at improving health literacy and promoting vaccination uptake by providing information and answering questions about the HPV vaccine.Methods We constructed the knowledge base (KB) for VaxBot-HPV, which consists of 451 documents from biomedical literature and web sources on the HPV vaccine. We extracted 202 question-answer pairs from the KB and 39 questions generated by GPT-4 for training and testing purposes. To comprehensively understand the capabilities and potential of GPT-based chatbots, 3 models were involved in this study: GPT-3.5, VaxBot-HPV, and GPT-4. The evaluation criteria included answer relevancy and faithfulness.Results VaxBot-HPV demonstrated superior performance in answer relevancy and faithfulness compared to baselines. For test questions in KB, it achieved an answer relevancy score of 0.85 and a faithfulness score of 0.97. Similarly, it attained scores of 0.85 for answer relevancy and 0.96 for faithfulness on GPT-generated questions.Discussion VaxBot-HPV demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuned large language models in healthcare, outperforming generic GPT models in accuracy and relevance. Fine-tuning mitigates hallucinations and misinformation, ensuring reliable information on HPV vaccination while allowing dynamic and tailored responses. The specific fine-tuning, which includes context in addition to question-answer pairs, enables VaxBot-HPV to provide explanations and reasoning behind its answers, enhancing transparency and user trust.Conclusions This study underscores the importance of leveraging large language models and fine-tuning techniques in the development of chatbots for healthcare applications, with implications for improving medical education and public health communication.
   This study introduces VaxBot-HPV, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot designed to provide reliable information and answer questions about the HPV vaccine, aiming to address common concerns and improve vaccine confidence. Leveraging the advanced language understanding features of the large language model GPT-3.5, VaxBot-HPV generates responses tailored to individual user questions, enabling it to dynamically address a wide range of topics beyond the capabilities of traditional systems. Unlike static, pre-scripted answers, VaxBot-HPV produces responses based on a deep understanding of the HPV vaccine, including addressing misconceptions and frequently asked questions. To ensure accuracy, the chatbot was fine-tuned specifically on HPV vaccine information, a process that allows it to overcome "hallucinations"-the generation of plausible yet incorrect responses-which are common in general-purpose AI. This approach enhances VaxBot-HPV's reliability and its ability to provide users with trustworthy answers. Our findings highlight the potential of VaxBot-HPV to support informed decision-making and improve health communication by offering clear, evidence-based responses to users. As an accessible tool, VaxBot-HPV represents a promising application of AI in healthcare, particularly in vaccine education, where reliable information is critical for public health outcomes.

AB  - Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized learning and support is becoming a promising tool in computing education. AI Assistants can help students with programming, problem-solving, converse with them to clarify course content, explain error messages to help with debugging, and much more. However, using cloud-based LLMs poses risks around data security, privacy, but also control of the overarching system.
   To address these concerns, we created a locally-stored Small Language Model (SLM) that leverages different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. We compare one SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 - fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1) against two popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) to see the viability for computing educators to use in their course(s).
   We use conversations from a CS1 course (N = 1, 260), providing students with an AI Assistant (using gpt-3.5-turbo) to help them learn content and support problem-solving while completing their Python programming assignment. In total, we had 269 students use the AI Assistant, with a total of 1, 988 questions asked. Using this real conversational data, we re-ran student questions using our novel SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 testing nine different RAG methods) and gpt-4-32k, then compared those results against the original gpt-3.5-turbo responses.
   Our findings indicate that using an SLM with RAG can perform similarly, if not better, than LLMs. This shows that it is possible for computing educators to use SLMs (with RAG) in their course(s) as a tool for scalable learning, supporting content understanding and problem-solving needs, while employing their own policies on data privacy and security.

AB  - This study investigates the validity and reliability of generative large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT and Google's Bard, in grading student essays in higher education based on an analytical grading rubric. A total of 15 experienced English as a foreign language (EFL) instructors and two LLMs were asked to evaluate three student essays of varying quality. The grading scale comprised five domains: grammar, content, organization, style & expression and mechanics. The results revealed that fine-tuned ChatGPT model demonstrated a very high level of reliability with an intraclass correlation (ICC) score of 0.972, Default ChatGPT model exhibited an ICC score of 0.947 and Bard showed a substantial level of reliability with an ICC score of 0.919. Additionally, a significant overlap was observed in certain domains when comparing the grades assigned by LLMs and human raters. In conclusion, the findings suggest that while LLMs demonstrated a notable consistency and potential for grading competency, further fine-tuning and adjustment are needed for a more nuanced understanding of non-objective essay criteria. The study not only offers insights into the potential use of LLMs in grading student essays but also highlights the need for continued development and research.What is already known about this topic Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, are known for their ability to generate text that mimics human-like conversation and writing. LLMs can perform various tasks, including essay grading. Intraclass correlation (ICC) is a statistical measure used to assess the reliability of ratings given by different raters (in this case, EFL instructors and LLMs). What this paper adds The study makes a unique contribution by directly comparing the grading performance of expert EFL instructors with two LLMs-ChatGPT and Bard-using an analytical grading scale. It provides robust empirical evidence showing high reliability of LLMs in grading essays, supported by high ICC scores. It specifically highlights that the overall efficacy of LLMs extends to certain domains of essay grading. Implications for practice and/or policy The findings open up potential new avenues for utilizing LLMs in academic settings, particularly for grading student essays, thereby possibly alleviating workload of educators. The paper's insistence on the need for further fine-tuning of LLMs underlines the continual interplay between technological advancement and its practical applications. The results lay down a footprint for future research in advancing the use of AI in essay grading.

AB  - Ethical hacking and penetration testing is a vital task by cybersecurity professionals to find and exploit possible vulnerabilities in a system before malicious actors do. However, system hacking has a high barrier to entry that necessitates years of experiential learning and formal education. The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) may potentially lower the barrier to entry. This research experiments with automatic penetration testing via large language models (LLMs) augmented with security information. This research uses a locally hosted Mistral 7B model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve penetration testing. When the LLMs are fine tuned with limited and unstructured security data such as privilege escalation articles from a few public web sites, the system succeeds in achieving privilege escalation on Linux hosts. The results of this research suggest that no-cost LLM-assisted penetration testing is possible even on ordinary PCs using locally hosted models. Future research is needed to achieve more diversified attacks and discover zero-day vulnerabilities, perhaps with better prompt engineering, models, and security data.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) transform healthcare by assisting clinicians with decision-making, research, and patient management. In gastroenterology, LLMs have shown potential in clinical decision support, data extraction, and patient education. However, challenges such as bias, hallucinations, integration with clinical workflows, and regulatory compliance must be addressed for safe and effective implementation. This manuscript presents a structured framework for integrating LLMs into gastroenterology, using Hepatitis C treatment as a real-world application. The framework outlines key steps to ensure accuracy, safety, and clinical relevance while mitigating risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven healthcare tools. The framework includes defining clinical goals, assembling a multidisciplinary team, data collection and preparation, model selection, fine-tuning, calibration, hallucination mitigation, user interface development, integration with electronic health records, real-world validation, and continuous improvement. Retrieval-augmented generation and fine-tuning approaches are evaluated for optimizing model adaptability. Bias detection, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and structured prompt engineering are incorporated to enhance reliability. Ethical and regulatory considerations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, General Data Protection Regulation, and AI-specific guidelines (DECIDE-AI, SPIRIT-AI, CONSORT-AI), are addressed to ensure responsible AI deployment. LLMs have the potential to enhance decision-making, research efficiency, and patient care in gastroenterology, but responsible deployment requires bias mitigation, transparency, and ongoing validation. Future research should focus on multi-institutional validation and AI-assisted clinical trials to establish LLMs as reliable tools in gastroenterology.

AB  - Peer feedback is a pedagogical strategy for peer learning. Despite recent indications of Large Language Models (LLMs) ' potential for content analysis, there is limited empirical exploration of their application in supporting the peer feedback process. This study enhances the analytical approach to peer feedback activities by employing state-of-the-art LLMs for automated peer feedback feature detection. This research critically compares three models-GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemini 1.0 Pro, and Claude 3 Sonnet-to evaluate their effectiveness in automated peer feedback feature detection. The study involved 69 engineering students from a Singapore university participating in peer feedback activities on the online platform Miro. A total of 535 peer feedback instances were collected and human-coded for eleven features, resulting in a dataset of 5,885 labeled samples. These features included various cognitive and affective dimensions, elaboration, and specificity. The results indicate that GPT-3.5 Turbo is the most effective model, offering the best combination of performance and cost-effectiveness. Gemini 1.0 Pro also presents a viable option with its higher throughput and larger context window, making it particularly suitable for educational contexts with smaller sample sizes. Conversely, Claude 3 Sonnet, despite its larger context window, is less competitive due to higher costs and lower performance, and its lack of support for training and fine-tuning with researchers' data weakens its learning capabilities. This research contributes to the fields of AI in education and peer feedback by exploring the use of LLMs for automated analysis. It highlights the feasibility of employing and fine-tuning existing LLMs to support pedagogical design and evaluations from a process-oriented perspective.

TI  - Detecting AI-Generated Code Assignments Using Perplexity of Large Language Models

LA  - English
CP  - 38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) / 36th Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 14th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Large language models like ChatGPT can generate human-like code, posing challenges for programming education as students may be tempted to misuse them on assignments. However, there are currently no robust detectors designed specifically to identify AI-generated code. This is an issue that needs to be addressed to maintain academic integrity while allowing proper utilization of language models. Previous work has explored different approaches to detect AI-generated text, including watermarks, feature analysis, and fine-tuning language models. In this paper, we address the challenge of determining whether a student's code assignment was generated by a language model. First, our proposed method identifies AI-generated code by leveraging targeted masking perturbation paired with comprehensive scoring. Rather than applying a random mask, areas of the code with higher perplexity are more intensely masked. Second, we utilize a fine-tuned CodeBERT to fill in the masked portions, producing subtle modified samples. Then, we integrate the overall perplexity, variation of code line perplexity, and burstiness into a unified score. In this scoring scheme, a higher rank for the original code suggests it's more likely to be AI-generated. This approach stems from the observation that AI-generated codes typically have lower perplexity. Therefore, perturbations often exert minimal influence on them. Conversely, sections of human-composed codes that the model struggles to understand can see their perplexity reduced by such perturbations. Our method outperforms current open-source and commercial text detectors. Specifically, it improves detection of code submissions generated by OpenAI's text-davinci-003, raising average AUC from 0.56 (GPTZero baseline) to 0.87 for our detector.

AB  - Generative AI (GenAI) based tutoring assistance has shown great potential in delivering adaptive and personalized education. The programming subjects, boasting a large on-campus student body and an active online presence via discussion boards, are well-suited for evaluating the accessibility, engagement, and satisfaction of GenAI-based tutoring assistance. In this paper, we explore the pros and cons of a GenAI-based feedback system, specifically fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM), as a potential tool for providing personalized programming subject matter expertise and guiding students towards solutions with interpretability and visualization. To better address the technical issues students encounter in programming and ensure our model provides accurate and professional debugging solutions, we further develop a visualized interaction tool for code interpretation and prompts optimization. Additionally, this paper compares the effectiveness of online discussion boards and the developed LLM in assisting students' questions and personalized support.

KW  - ACCEPTANCE
AB  - This paper investigates the implementation of AI-driven feedback in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) developed for training of counselors. By using LLMs, the study explores the automatic generation of feedback for communication-intensive tasks such as online counseling. The evaluation compares different feedback methods, including the sandwich, WWW and STATE methods, and assesses their emotional and objective impact. The results show that AI-generated feedback fulfills objective criteria better than emotional ones. Fine-tuning an open source LLM can improve both the emotional and objective quality of feedback. Furthermore, the study examines the acceptance of AI feedback among aspiring counselors, highlighting the influence of familiarity with AI on acceptance levels. Ethical considerations, including bias and hallucination, are addressed, with recommendations for risk mitigation through multi-feedback options and expert supervision. This research contributes to the understanding of the role of AI in improving digital counseling practices and highlights the need for continuous evaluation and ethical considerations.

AB  - Handwriting Mathematical Expression Recognition has several applications, including the potential to make Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) more accessible to underserved regions. However, young children's handwriting pose several challenges, even for instructors, calling for advanced approaches to understand their writings. This paper explores the potential of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLM) for recognizing numbers or mathematical expressions handwritten by children by comparing GPT-4V, LLaVA 1.5, and CogVLM on a dataset of 251 images. Results indicate that while pre-trained models offer promise, their performance without fine-tuning or zero-shot learning remains inadequate. Results reveal the challenges of utilizing pre-trained VLMs for recognizing children's handwriting, particularly in educational settings. Issues such as poor handwriting and partial erasures pose difficulties for existing models, with GPT-4V's safety system limitations hindering its efficacy. In general, CogVLM presented the best performance. GPT-4V exhibited superior performance in recognizing equations, but still struggles with handwritten content, highlighting the need for model refinement and data policies. This study contributes insights into the potential of existing pre-trained models in educational contexts and demonstrates the importance of, for example, fine-tuning to domain-specific datasets. Continued research is necessary to enhance VLM capabilities for educational support, particularly in children's handwriting recognition.

AB  - This study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic Question Generation in educational settings. Three LLMs are compared in their ability to create questions from university slide text without fine-tuning. Questions were obtained in a two-step pipeline: first, answer phrases were extracted from slides using Llama 2-Chat 13B; then, the three models generated questions for each answer. To analyze whether the questions would be suitable in educational applications for students, a survey was conducted with 46 students who evaluated a total of 246 questions across five metrics: clarity, relevance, difficulty, slide relation, and question-answer alignment. Results indicate that GPT-3.5 and Llama 2-Chat 13B outperform Flan T5 XXL by a small margin, particularly in terms of clarity and question-answer alignment. GPT-3.5 especially excels at tailoring questions to match the input answers. The contribution of this research is the analysis of the capacity of LLMs for Automatic Question Generation in education.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for domain-specific text generation in surgical and anesthesia residency education. Summary background data: With growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) for medical training, the potential of LLMs to transform residency education is explored. Methods: The 7-billion parameter base model "Vicuna v1.5" was trained on 266,342 lines of text from 821 peerreviewed documents. We evaluated the model with 150 surgical or anesthesia queries and assessed accuracy, token count, and inference speed across various reasoning tasks. Tests of significance were conducted using ANOVA and chi-square analysis. Results: Our model achieved 65.3% accuracy, excelling in surgical case-based tasks. We found no significant difference in accuracy between knowledge domains (P=0.081), though longer response generation demonstrated poorer accuracy, with significant accuracy variation based on output length (P = 0.002). Conclusions: LLMs show potential in enhancing residency education. Our model's efficiency and task-specific accuracy highlights such promise, though limits in parameter count diminishes accuracy of longer response generation. Our findings showcase how AI may be integrated effectively within future residency training.

AB  - In today's fast-paced academic environment, efficient access to professional development resources is of paramount importance. This study investigates the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the LangChain framework to develop a question answering (QA) system using the Llama-2 large-language model. The QA system was designed to improve information retrieval accuracy and relevance for policy-related questions based on the handbook for the faculty and non-teaching staff development program at Iloilo Science and Technology University, Philippines. By leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the system processes natural language questions and retrieves relevant information from diverse data sources such as handbook and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in PDF format. The QLoRA technique was employed for model fine-tuning with 4-bit precision and the optimization of VRAM usage while retaining its high performance. The fine-tuned model indicated that the training process for question and answering reached the 105th global step, along with its training loss and other training metrics, including runtime, samples processed per second, steps processed per second, total floating-point operations, and epoch information. Thus, this study demonstrates that this approach enhances information accessibility and support efficiency within academic institutions, especially during times of crisis like pandemic. Future research could further enhance QA systems to augment question-answering systems by integrating personalized features, cutting-edge natural language processing techniques, affective computing techniques, machine learning strategies, and corresponding evaluation performance metrics.

AB  - The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in education holds much promise. However, like many technological innovations before them, adoption and access can often be inequitable from the outset, creating more divides than they bridge. In this paper, we explore the magnitude of the country and language divide in the leading open-source and proprietary LLMs with respect to knowledge of K-12 taxonomies in a variety of countries and their performance on tagging problem content with the appropriate skill from a taxonomy, an important task for aligning open educational resources and tutoring content with state curricula. We also experiment with approaches to narrowing the performance divide by enhancing LLM skill tagging performance across four countries (the USA, Ireland, South Korea and India-Maharashtra) for more equitable outcomes. We observe considerable performance disparities not only with non-English languages but with English and non-US taxonomies. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning GPT-3.5 with a few labelled examples can improve its proficiency in tagging problems with relevant skills or standards, even for countries and languages that are underrepresented during training. Furthermore, the fine-tuning results show the potential viability of GPT as a multilingual skill classifier. Using both an open-source model, Llama2-13B, and a closed-source model, GPT-3.5, we also observe large disparities in tagging performance between the two and find that fine-tuning and skill information in the prompt improve both, but the closed-source model improves to a much greater extent. Our study contributes to the first empirical results on mitigating disparities across countries and languages with LLMs in an educational context.Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Recent advances in generative AI have led to increased applications of LLMs in education, offering diverse opportunities. LLMs excel predominantly in English and exhibit a bias towards the US context. Automated content tagging has been studied using English-language content and taxonomies. What this paper adds Investigates the country and language disparities in LLMs concerning knowledge of educational taxonomies and their performance in tagging content. Presents the first empirical findings on addressing disparities in LLM performance across countries and languages within an educational context. Improves GPT-3.5's tagging accuracy through fine-tuning, even for non-US countries, starting from zero accuracy. Extends automated content tagging to non-English languages using both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Implications for practice and/or policy Underscores the importance of considering the performance generalizability of LLMs to languages other than English. Highlights the potential viability of ChatGPT as a skill tagging classifier across countries.

AB  - The transformative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are reshaping educational assessment and question design in higher education. This study proposes a systematic framework for leveraging LLMs to enhance question-centric tasks: aligning exam questions with course objectives, improving clarity and difficulty, and generating new items guided by learning goals. The research spans four university courses-two theory-focused and two application-focused-covering diverse cognitive levels according to Bloom's taxonomy. A balanced dataset ensures representation of question categories and structures. Three LLM-based agents-VectorRAG, VectorGraphRAG, and a fine-tuned LLM-are developed and evaluated against a meta-evaluator, supervised by human experts, to assess alignment accuracy and explanation quality. Robust analytical methods, including mixed-effects modeling, yield actionable insights for integrating generative AI into university assessment processes. Beyond exam-specific applications, this methodology provides a foundational approach for the broader adoption of AI in post-secondary education, emphasizing fairness, contextual relevance, and collaboration. The findings offer a comprehensive framework for aligning AI-generated content with learning objectives, detailing effective integration strategies, and addressing challenges such as bias and contextual limitations. Overall, this work underscores the potential of generative AI to enhance educational assessment while identifying pathways for responsible implementation.

AB  - This systematic review investigates 49 peer-reviewed studies on Large Language Model-Powered Automated Assessment (LLMPAA) published between 2018 and 2024. Following PRISMA guidelines, studies were selected from Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed databases. The analysis shows that LLMPAA has been widely applied in reading comprehension, language education, and computer science, primarily using essay and short-answer formats. While models such as GPT-4 and fine-tuned BERT often exhibit high agreement with human raters (e.g., QWK = 0.99, r = 0.95), other studies report lower agreement (e.g., ICC = 0.45, r = 0.38). LLMPAA offers benefits like efficiency, scalability, and personalized feedback. However, significant challenges remain, including bias, inconsistency, hallucination, limited explainability, dataset quality, and privacy concerns. These findings indicate that while LLMPAA technologies hold promise, their effectiveness varies by context. Human oversight is essential to ensure fair and reliable assessment outcomes.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of large language models, there has been a growing interest in their capabilities in mathematical reasoning. However, existing research has primarily focused on text-based algebra problems, neglecting the study of geometry due to the lack of high-quality geometric datasets. To address this gap, this paper introduces AutoGeo, a novel approach for automatically generating mathematical geometric images to fulfill the demand for large-scale and diverse geometric datasets. AutoGeo facilitates the creation of AutoGeo-100 k, an extensive repository comprising 100 k high-quality geometry image-text pairs. By leveraging precisely defined geometric clauses, AutoGeo-100 k contains a wide variety of geometric shapes, including lines, polygons, circles, and complex spatial relationships, etc. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the efficacy of AutoGeo-100 k in enhancing the performance of multimodal large language models through fine-tuning. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in the model's ability in handling geometric images, as evidenced by enhanced accuracy in tasks such as geometric captioning and mathematical reasoning. This research not only fills a critical gap in the availability of geometric datasets but also paves the way for the advancement of sophisticated AI-driven tools in education and research.

AB  - Global rates of mental health concerns are rising, and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental health care will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this paper, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs' application to mental health and encourage the adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. It is especially critical to ensure that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, and adhere to ethical standards and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to transform various aspects of healthcare. This review aims to explore the current applications, challenges, and future prospects of LLMs in medical education, clinical decision support, and healthcare administration. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted, examining the applications of LLMs across the three key domains. The analysis included their performance, challenges, and advancements, with a focus on techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Results: In medical education, LLMs show promise as virtual patients, personalized tutors, and tools for generating study materials. Some models have outperformed junior trainees in specific medical knowledge assessments. Concerning clinical decision support, LLMs exhibit potential in diagnostic assistance, treatment recommendations, and medical knowledge retrieval, though performance varies across specialties and tasks. In healthcare administration, LLMs effectively automate tasks like clinical note summarization, data extraction, and report generation, potentially reducing administrative burdens on healthcare professionals. Despite their promise, challenges persist, including hallucination mitigation, addressing biases, and ensuring patient privacy and data security. Conclusions: LLMs have transformative potential in medicine but require careful integration into healthcare settings. Ethical considerations, regulatory challenges, and interdisciplinary collaboration between AI developers and healthcare professionals are essential. Future advancements in LLM performance and reliability through techniques such as RAG, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning will be critical to ensuring patient safety and improving healthcare delivery.

AB  - The last two decades of online learning research vastly flourished by examining discussion board text data through content analysis based on constructs like cognitive presence (CP) with the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM). The PIM sets a footprint for how cognitive development unfolds in collaborative inquiry in online learning experiences. Ironically, content analysis is a resource-intensive endeavor in terms of time and expertise, making researchers look for ways to automate text classification through ensemble machine-learning algorithms. We leveraged large language models (LLMs) through OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models in the public API to automate the content analysis of students' text data based on PIM indicators and assess the reliability and efficiency of automated content analysis compared to human analysis. Using the seven steps of the Large Language Model Content Analysis (LACA) approach, we proposed an AI-adapted CP codebook leveraging prompt engineering techniques (i.e., role, chain-of-thought, one-shot, few-shot) for the automated content analysis of CP. We found that a fine-tuned model with a one-shot prompt achieved moderate interrater reliability with researchers. The models were more reliable when classifying students' discussion board text in the Integration phase of the PIM. A cost comparison showed an obvious cost advantage of LACA approaches in online learning research in terms of efficiency. Nevertheless, practitioners still need considerable data literacy skills to deploy LACA at a scale. We offer theoretical suggestions for simplifying the CP codebook and improving the IRR with LLM. Implications for practice are discussed, and future research that includes instructional advice is recommended.

AB  - The emerging research area of large language models (LLMs) has far-reaching implications for various aspects of our daily lives. In education, in particular, LLMs hold enormous potential for enabling personalized learning and equal opportunities for all students. In a traditional classroom environment, students often struggle to develop individual writing skills because the workload of the teachers limits their ability to provide detailed feedback on each student's essay. To bridge this gap, we have developed a tool called PEER (Paper Evaluation and Empowerment Resource) which exploits the power of LLMs and provides students with comprehensive and engaging feedback on their essays. Our goal is to motivate each student to enhance their writing skills through positive feedback and specific suggestions for improvement. Since its launch in February 2023, PEER has received high levels of interest and demand, resulting in more than 4000 essays uploaded to the platform to date. Moreover, there has been an overwhelming response from teachers who are interested in the project since it has the potential to alleviate their workload by making the task of grading essays less tedious. By collecting a real-world data set incorporating essays of students and feedback from teachers, we will be able to refine and enhance PEER through model fine-tuning in the next steps. Our goal is to leverage LLMs to enhance personalized learning, reduce teacher workload, and ensure that every student has an equal opportunity to excel in writing.

AB  - This study proposes a method for knowledge distillation (KD) of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient, and accurate neural networks. We specifically target the challenge of deploying these models on resource-constrained devices. Our methodology involves training the smaller student model (Neural Network) using the prediction probabilities (as soft labels) of the LLM, which serves as a teacher model. This is achieved through a specialized loss function tailored to learn from the LLM's output probabilities, ensuring that the student model closely mimics the teacher's performance. To validate the performance of the KD approach, we utilized a large dataset, 7T, containing 6,684 student-written responses to science questions and three mathematical reasoning datasets with student-written responses graded by human experts. We compared accuracy with state-of-the-art (SOTA) distilled models, TinyBERT, and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Results have shown that the KD approach has 3% and 2% higher scoring accuracy than ANN and TinyBERT, respectively, and comparable accuracy to the teacher model. Furthermore, the student model size is 0.03M, 4,000 times smaller in parameters and x10 faster in inferencing than the teacher model and TinyBERT, respectively. The significance of this research lies in its potential to make advanced AI technologies accessible in typical educational settings, particularly for automatic scoring.

AB  - Across various fields of human life, the lightning adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is driven by their ease of use and ability to produce high-quality outputs, transforming communication and productivity. However, the growing popularity and influence of models such as ChatGPT have raised concerns in education regarding academic integrity, as AI-generated content challenges the authenticity of student work and complicates traditional assessment practices. Existing plagiarism detection tools, such as Turnitin and GPTZero, attempt to identify AI-generated content; however, their reliability remains limited, as most struggle to accurately differentiate between human and AI essays. To address existing tools limitations, we propose a novel detection model leveraging three large language models (LLMs): Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2), Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). We first fine-tuned each model on two large-scale datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between human and AI-generated essays. To further enhance the performance, we applied both manual and automated hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Random Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Building on these experiments, we developed our BART-CNN model, which incorporates the best-performing BART configuration with an additional convolutional head classifier. Our BART-CNN model achieved impressive Macro F1-scores of 99.78% and 98.10% on the Kaggle and Hugging Face datasets, respectively, and demonstrated significant performance gains over baseline methods in cross-domain validation. Our study offers a critical advancement in AI plagiarism detection, helping to uphold academic standards and the assessment quality in an evolving AI landscape.

AB  - Experts assert that Large Language Model (LLM) based tools like ChatGPT are the next generation in the evolution of Artificial Intelligence and will permeate all walks of human life including education. The current narrative is that we need to embed the LLM-based tools into the system taking advantage of their personalised, dynamic, adaptive nature while being mindful of their limitations. One of the greatest limitations so far identified is that these pre-trained transformer-based encoder models fine-tuned on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks do not reveal verifiable reasoning ability. As a result, the information generated by these tools is subject to ethical and factual errors that need human oversight. This paper uses the integrative literature review to identify and synthesize Critical Digital Literacy frameworks in language teaching in the light of the essential competencies and learning domains identified by the UNESCO Education for Sustainable Development directives. The Critical AI Literacy framework proposed in this paper would enable language teachers to adopt LLM-based tools to enhance their instructional strategies. The cognitive, affective and conative competencies developed through the new CAIL framework would empower learners to understand the manipulative nature of language and use language to build a sustainable future.

AB  - In this study, we introduce a Conversational Intelligent Tutoring System designed to create an interactive and immersive learning experience aimed at improving the speaking abilities of second language learners. This system mimics a human tutor by engaging in role-play dialogues with the learner, based on predefined scenarios, and offers corrective feedback on the learners' utterance, while also engaging in chat to encourage student participation. The tutoring system includes a deep-learning classifier to assess students' utterances, a dialogue generator customized for responding to students' free-form chats, and a straightforward dialogue manager to determine the sequence of conversational turns. To tackle the challenge posed by the scarcity of tutoring dialogue resources, a significant hurdle for deep learning methods, we present a cost-effective approach that efficiently extends existing Korean dialogue datasets for the purpose of intelligent language tutoring. We carried out a series of experiments to compare various finetuned models based on language models of different sizes, and included a comparative analysis with ChatGPT. We discovered that smaller, specialized, fine-tuned models can either surpass or match the performance of GPT-4 in specific tutoring applications. Given the educational sector's demand for cost-effective solutions, our contributions, spanning system design, dataset development, and comparative analysis, serve as valuable references to address these needs.

AB  - Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant and popular form of NAI, presents a promising avenue for advancing personalized instruction via neurosymbolic educational agents. By leveraging structured knowledge, these agents can provide individualized learning experiences that align with specific learner preferences and desired learning paths, while also mitigating biases inherent in traditional AI systems. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of KGs, LLMs, and pedagogical agents - embodied characters designed to enhance learning - as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.

AB  - In recent years, the pre-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the educational domain has garnered significant attention. However, a discernible gap exists in the application of these models to mathematics education. This study aims to bridge this gap by pre-training LLMs on authentic K-12 mathematical dialogue datasets. Our research is structured around three primary research questions (RQs) that investigate the impact of fine-tuning data size and pre-training in downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, and the efficacy of LLMs in text generation tasks within the mathematical context. Our findings indicate that data size plays a pivotal role in the performance of LLMs in downstream NLP tasks, with larger datasets yielding more consistent and improved results. Furthermore, pre-trained models consistently outperformed their non-pre-trained counterparts, emphasizing the importance of leveraging prior knowledge in LLMs. In the realm of text generation, we found that our model can not only enhance mathematical understanding and performance on downstream math tasks but also generate more engaging and human-like language.

AB  - The adoption of technology in medical education, including the use of situational judgment tests (SJTs), reflects the field's evolving nature. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Situational Judgment Test (SJT) is understood to be the gold standard to assess pre-professional competencies in prospective medical students. Thus, the impact of such an exam is extensive and students' abilities to engage with it can deeply impact the future of health professions - in particular, medical education. This study aims to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in interpreting and responding to the AAMC SJT to understand the opportunities for its use and the obstacles that might exist. The study utilized the 2021 AAMC SJT practice exam, querying the LLMs to rate the effectiveness of various behavioral responses to each scenario. Both exact and similar agreement scores were calculated in accordance with AAMC's guidelines. Statistical analysis involved descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and the calculation of Fleiss Kappa for inter-model agreement. LLMs at various stages of development were compared, with the idea that improvements might occur, a finding which would be of interest to educators using AI tools to evaluate SJTs, to prospective health professions trainees interested in preparing for such exams, and practicing professionals who aim to improve or fine tune their social intelligence-related skills. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT-4.0 (exact agreement score: 58.6%, similar agreement score: 71.2%) outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 (exact agreement score: 42.4%, similar agreement score: 61.6%) and Bard (exact agreement score: 37.6%, similar agreement score: 58.1%) with all LLMs tending towards making the same inaccuracies. Increased solution count in scenarios correlated with decreased accuracy across all models combined but these results fell short of statistical significance. Ultimately, our study contributes to understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the context of medical education assessments. ChatGPT-4.0's performance indicates a significant advancement in LLMs' ability to interpret and respond to complex social situations.

AB  - This paper advances contextual image understanding within perspective-aware Ai (PAi), an emerging paradigm in human-computer interaction that enables users to perceive and interact through each other's perspectives. While PAi relies on multimodal data-such as text, audio, and images-challenges in data collection, alignment, and privacy have led us to focus on enabling the contextual understanding of images. To achieve this, we developed perspective-aware scene graph generation with LLM post-processing (PASGG-LM). This framework extends traditional scene graph generation (SGG) by incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance contextual understanding. PASGG-LM integrates classical scene graph outputs with LLM post-processing to infer richer contextual information, such as emotions, activities, and social contexts. To test PASGG-LM, we introduce the context-aware scene graph generation task, where the goal is to generate a context-aware situation graph describing the input image. We evaluated PASGG-LM pipelines using state-of-the-art SGG models, including Motifs, Motifs-TDE, and RelTR, and showed that fine-tuning LLMs, particularly GPT-4o-mini and Llama-3.1-8B, improves performance in terms of R@K, mR@K, and mAP. Our method is capable of generating scene graphs that capture complex contextual aspects, advancing human-machine interaction by enhancing the representation of diverse perspectives. Future directions include refining contextual scene graph models and expanding multi-modal data integration for PAi applications in domains such as healthcare, education, and social robotics.

AB  - In this study, we explore the efficacy of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in the tasks of constructing and completing Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs). Knowledge Graphs (KGs) help represent real-world relationships. This can take the form of modeling course domains and student progression in educational settings. Through this work, we leverage GPT-4 to aid KG construction and align it with predefined learning objectives, course structure, and human interaction in validating and refining the generated KGs. The methodology employed utilized prompting LLMs with course materials and evaluating the generation of KGs through automatic and human assessment. Through a series of experiments, we show the potential of LLMs in enhancing the EduKG construction process, particularly for course modeling. Our findings suggest that LLMs such as GPT-4 can augment EduKGs by suggesting valuable and contextually relevant triplets. This KG creation and augmentation approach shows the potential to reduce the workload on educators and adaptive learning systems, paving the way for future applications in content recommendation and personalized learning experiences.

KW  - large language models
KW  - retrieval-augmented generation
KW  - rheumatology
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly transforming rheumatology with research on disease detection, monitoring, and outcome prediction through the analysis of large datasets. The advent of generative models and large language models (LLMs) has expanded AI's capabilities, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering and medical literature synthesis. While NLP has shown promise in identifying rheumatic diseases from electronic health records with high accuracy, LLMs face significant challenges, including hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific knowledge, which limit their reliability in specialized medical fields like rheumatology. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a solution to these limitations by integrating LLMs with real-time access to external, domain-specific databases. RAG enhances the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses by retrieving pertinent information during the generation process, reducing hallucinations, and improving the trustworthiness of AI applications. This architecture allows for precise, context-aware outputs and can handle unstructured data effectively. Despite its success in other industries, the application of RAG in medicine, and specifically in rheumatology, remains underexplored. Potential applications in rheumatology include retrieving up-to-date clinical guidelines, summarizing complex patient histories from unstructured data, aiding in patient identification for clinical trials, enhancing pharmacovigilance efforts, and supporting personalized patient education. RAG also offers advantages in data privacy by enabling local data handling and reducing reliance on large, general-purpose models. Future directions involve integrating RAG with fine-tuned, smaller LLMs and exploring multimodal models that can process diverse data types. Challenges such as infrastructure costs, data privacy concerns, and the need for specialized evaluation metrics must be addressed. Nevertheless, RAG presents a promising opportunity to improve AI applications in rheumatology, offering a more precise, accountable, and sustainable approach to integrating advanced language models into clinical practice and research.

AB  - Current research aims to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for tutoring beginning programming students efficiently and at scale. Students often struggle to interact effectively with LLMs to obtain meaningful feedback. We introduce an LLM-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) with a structured interface and prompts aligned with Hattie's feedback model. To provide more focused feedback, we utilize the user interaction history for context. Additionally, we explore the question of proactivity.
   A user study with 9 participants compared history-based and current-state feedback methods using ChatGPT, showing a preference for history-based feedback in 69% of cases and with higher usefulness ratings (M = 7.57 vs. M = 4.1, p = 0.03 (statistically significant at p < 0.05)). This effect became more pronounced in later learning stages. For proactivity, we collected user data from the study, where participants explicitly requested feedback, and trained a neural network (NN) to predict optimal feedback timing. While the model achieved 97% accuracy on test data, the small sample size (N = 10) and the use of oversampling limit its generalizability. Future work will refine history-based feedback with eye-tracking data and integrate NN-driven proactive behavior to further enhance the effectiveness of LLM-based ITS in programming education.

AB  - Digital education has gained popularity in the last decade, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. With the improving capabilities of large language models to reason and communicate with users, envisioning intelligent tutoring systems that can facilitate self-learning is not very far-fetched. One integral component to fulfill this vision is the ability to give accurate and effective feedback via hints to scaffold the learning process. In this survey article, we present a comprehensive review of prior research on hint generation, aiming to bridge the gap between research in education and cognitive science, and research in AI and Natural Language Processing. Informed by our findings, we propose a formal definition of the hint generation task, and discuss the roadmap of building an effective hint generation system aligned with the formal definition, including open challenges, future directions and ethical considerations.

AB  - In 2018, OpenAI introduced the first version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), revolutionizing the future of Large Language Models (LLMs). This model demonstrated the potential of pretraining large-scale models with vast text data and then fine-tuning them for specific tasks to the public. LLMs have quickly penetrated educational environments, aiding students from various disciplines in tasks ranging from initiating research to drafting essays. While the latter may breach academic integrity, the former is highly beneficial, especially for exploring new areas or ideas. Comparatively, the user interactions with GPT might resembles initially with that of search engines, despite technological differences, as both provide answers to queries, often reflecting archived as well as mainstream views. The historical evolution of search engines, from Archie's database matching to Google's relevance-based ranking, highlights similar ethical considerations faced by both technologies. The development of search engines underscored the importance of accessible information, a principle equally relevant to GPT and LLMs today. This paper is written in light of recent coming into force of European Union's legal framework on artificial intelligence for the purpose of examining adoption of LLMs in classrooms, and argues for balanced regulations across jurisdictions that acknowledge both the immense educational potential of LLMs and the need for adherence to legal and ethical standards.

TI  - On The Persona-based Summarization of Domain-Specific Documents
T2  - FINDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: ACL 2024
LA  - English
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - In an ever-expanding world of domain-specific knowledge, the increasing complexity of consuming, and storing information necessitates the generation of summaries from large information repositories. However, every persona of a domain has different requirements of information and hence their summarization. For example, in the healthcare domain, a persona-based (such as Doctor, Nurse, Patient etc.) approach is imperative to deliver targeted medical information efficiently. Persona-based summarization of domain-specific information by humans is a high cognitive load task and is generally not preferred. The summaries generated by two different humans have high variability and do not scale in cost and subject matter expertise as domains and personas grow. Further, AI-generated summaries using generic Large Language Models (LLMs) may not necessarily offer satisfactory accuracy for different domains unless they have been specifically trained on domain-specific data and can also be very expensive to use in day-to-day operations. Our contribution in this paper is two-fold: 1) We present an approach to efficiently fine-tune a domain-specific small foundation LLM using a healthcare corpus and also show that we can effectively evaluate the summarization quality using AI-based critiquing. 2) We further show that AI-based critiquing has good concordance with Human-based critiquing of the summaries. Hence, such AI-based pipelines to generate domain-specific persona-based summaries can be easily scaled to other domains such as legal, enterprise documents, education etc. in a very efficient and cost-effective manner.

AB  - Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be leveraged by higher-ed administrators to augment information-driven support services. But due to the incredibly rapid innovation rate in the field, it is challenging to develop and implement state-of-the-art systems in such institutions. This work describes an end-to-end methodology that educational institutions can utilize as a roadmap to implement open domain question-answering (ODQA) to develop their own intelligent assistants on their online platforms. We show that applying a retriever-reader framework composed of an information retrieval component that encodes sparse document vectors, and a reader component based on BERT-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers- fine-tuned with domain specific data, provides a robust, easy-to-implement architecture for ODQA. Experiments are carried out using variations of BERT fine-tuned with a corpus of questions and answers derived from our institution's website.

KW  - FOUNDATION MODELS
AB  - Computational pathology1,2 has witnessed considerable progress in the development of both task-specific predictive models and task-agnostic self-supervised vision encoders3,4. However, despite the explosive growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI), there have been few studies on building general-purpose multimodal AI assistants and copilots5 tailored to pathology. Here we present PathChat, a vision-language generalist AI assistant for human pathology. We built PathChat by adapting a foundational vision encoder for pathology, combining it with a pretrained large language model and fine-tuning the whole system on over 456,000 diverse visual-language instructions consisting of 999,202 question and answer turns. We compare PathChat with several multimodal vision-language AI assistants and GPT-4V, which powers the commercially available multimodal general-purpose AI assistant ChatGPT-4 (ref. 6). PathChat achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple-choice diagnostic questions from cases with diverse tissue origins and disease models. Furthermore, using open-ended questions and human expert evaluation, we found that overall PathChat produced more accurate and pathologist-preferable responses to diverse queries related to pathology. As an interactive vision-language AI copilot that can flexibly handle both visual and natural language inputs, PathChat may potentially find impactful applications in pathology education, research and human-in-the-loop clinical decision-making.
   PathChat, a multimodal generative AI copilot for human pathology, has been trained on a large dataset of visual-language instructions to interactively assist users with diverse pathology tasks.

AB  - Traditional grading methods are often time-consuming and subjective, increasing the difficulties in maintaining academic integrity against the background of easy access to online resources. Even as pre-written and AI-generated content become even more available, handwritten essays offer one of the most viable ways of stimulating real learning and original thought among students. This study assessed the accuracy and efficiency of AI-powered grading to improve education amid these challenges. More precisely, the paper investigated the possibility of automatically grading the handwritten open-ended reflection essays of students in the "Living in the IT Era" course by leveraging AI. Through Optical Character Recognition (OCR), together with a fine-tuned and trained Large Language Model (LLM) Mistral 7b, the system replicated human-grading decisions in evaluating essays comprehensively. The predicted score and human-graded score were compared in evaluating the system. Analysis using BERT Score revealed a high degree of correlation between the two, with consistent precision (88.41%), recall (83.33%), and F1-score (85.78%). External user testing also revealed a positive perception: the system is perceived as user-friendly (usability: 4.28), generally understandable (comprehensibility: 3.68), and with functionalities relevant to educators' needs (relevance: 4.0). This study adds to the expanding body of research on AI in education and lays the groundwork for future investigations in this area.

AB  - Background: The GPT-4 is a large language model (LLM) trained and fine-tuned on an extensive dataset. After the public release of its predecessor in November 2022, the use of LLMs has seen a significant spike in interest, and a multitude of potential use cases have been proposed. In parallel, however, important limitations have been outlined. Particularly, current LLMs encounter limitations, especially in symbolic representation and accessing contemporary data. The recent version of GPT-4, alongside newly released plugin features, has been introduced to mitigate some of these limitations.
   Objective: Before this background, this work aims to investigate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 with plugins, and GPT-4 with plugins using pretranslated English text on the German medical board examination. Recognizing the critical importance of quantifying uncertainty for LLM applications in medicine, we furthermore assess this ability and develop a new metric termed "confidence accuracy" to evaluate it.
   Methods: We used GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 with plugins, and GPT-4 with plugins and translation to answer questions from the German medical board examination. Additionally, we conducted an analysis to assess how the models justify their answers, the accuracy of their responses, and the error structure of their answers. Bootstrapping and CIs were used to evaluate the statistical significance of our findings.
   Results: This study demonstrated that available GPT models, as LLM examples, exceeded the minimum competency threshold established by the German medical board for medical students to obtain board certification to practice medicine. Moreover, the models could assess the uncertainty in their responses, albeit exhibiting overconfidence. Additionally, this work unraveled certain justification and reasoning structures that emerge when GPT generates answers.
   Conclusions: The high performance of GPTs in answering medical questions positions it well for applications in academia and, potentially, clinical practice. Its capability to quantify uncertainty in answers suggests it could be a valuable artificial intelligence agent within the clinical decision-making loop. Nevertheless, significant challenges must be addressed before artificial intelligence agents can be robustly and safely implemented in the medical domain.

AB  - In a typical introductory programming course, grading student-submitted programs involves an autograder which compiles and runs the programs and tests their functionality with predefined test cases, with no attention to the source code. However, in an educational setting, grading based on inspection of the source code is required for two main reasons (1) awarding partial marks to 'partially correct' code that may be failing the testcase check (2) awarding marks (or penalties) based on source code quality or specific criteria that the instructor may have laid out in the problem statement (e.g. 'implement sorting using bubble-sort'). However, grading based on studying the source code can be highly time consuming when the course has a large enrollment. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of an AI Assistant for source code grading, which we have named TA Buddy. TA Buddy is powered by Code Llama, a large language model especially trained for code related tasks, which we fine-tuned using a graded programs dataset. Given a problem statement, student code submissions and a grading rubric, TA Buddy can be asked to generate suggested grades, i.e. ratings for the various rubric criteria, for each submission. The human teaching assistant (TA) can then accept or overrule these grades. We evaluated the TA Buddy-assisted manual grading against 'pure' manual grading and found that the time taken to grade reduced by 24% while maintaining grade agreement in the two cases at 90%.

AB  - Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student's error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4's annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

AB  - This paper presents a detailed study of an AI-driven platform designed for the training of child welfare and law enforcement professionals in conducting investigative interviews with maltreated children. It achieves a subjective simulation of interview situation through the integration of fine-tuned GPT-3 models within the Unity framework. The study recruited participants from a range of backgrounds, including professionals experienced in conducting investigative interviews and individuals with academic qualifications in psychology, criminology, or related disciplines. To assess the effectiveness of this tool, a multi-method evaluation approach was utilized, incorporating both quantitative analyses and qualitative interviews. The quantitative methods included mixed-effects models, which provided insights into how effects such as the type of virtual environment (2D vs. 3D), scenario variations, virtual reality (VR) familiarity, and professional expertise influence the user experience. Additionally, structural equation modeling (SEM) provided deeper insights into the relationships between variables, offering a comprehensive understanding of how they collectively impact the user experience. The qualitative method included a detailed semi-structured interview that provided a deeper understanding of user experiences and perceptions. The findings indicate significant advantages of the 3D environment in enhancing Flow and Virtual Fidelity; however, the 2D environment was favored for Usability. Despite the 3D environment's potential for greater immersion, the discomfort associated with VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) led some users to prefer the 2D setup. Familiarity with VR technology positively influenced user perception, indicating that prior exposure can mitigate some of the Avatar Interaction Comfort issues. Additionally, the Hand Movement Perception was better understood in scenarios with sensitive themes. As user experience increased, participants had a more positive view of the Age-Appropriate Response. Furthermore, the dialog system's effectiveness, particularly Response Relevance and Detailed Responses, played a significant role in Empathy Elicitation, often outweighing Virtual Fidelity. However, Emotion in facial expressions and Responsiveness were two factors that negatively impacted the effectiveness of the tool, indicating areas that need improvement in the future.

AB  - The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language comprehension, conversational interaction, and content generation have led to their widespread adoption across various educational stages and contexts. Given the fundamental role of education, concerns are rising about whether LLMs can serve as competent teachers. To address the challenge of comprehensively evaluating the competencies of LLMs as teachers, a systematic quantitative evaluation based on the competency model has emerged as a valuable approach. Our study, grounded in the teacher competency model and drawing from 14 existing scales, constructed an evaluation framework called TeacherComp. Based on TeacherComp, we evaluated six LLMs from OpenAI across four dimensions: knowledge, skills, values, and traits. Through comparisons between LLMs' responses and human norms, we found that: 1) with each successive update, LLMs have shown overall improvements in knowledge, while their skills dimension scores have increasingly aligned with human norms; 2) there are both commonalities and differences in the performance of various LLMs regarding values and traits. For instance, while they all tend to exhibit more negative traits than humans, their morals can vary; and 3) LLMs with reduced security, constructed using jailbreak techniques, exhibit values and traits more closely aligned with human norms. Building on these findings, we provided interpretations and suggestions for the application of LLMs in various educational contexts. Overall, this study helps teachers and students use LLMs in appropriate contexts and provides developers with guidance for future iterations, thereby advancing the role of LLMs in empowering education.

T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Generative AI technologies such as large language models show novel potential to enhance educational research. For example, generative large language models were shown to be capable of solving quantitative reasoning tasks in physics and concept tests such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). Given the importance of such concept inventories for physics education research, and the challenges in developing them such as field testing with representative populations, this study seeks to examine to what extent a generative large language model could be utilized to generate a synthetic dataset for the FCI that exhibits content-related variability in responses. We use the recently introduced ChatGPT based on the GPT 4 generative large language model and investigate to what extent ChatGPT could solve the FCI accurately (RQ1) and could be prompted to solve the FCI as if it were a student belonging to a different cohort (RQ2). Furthermore, we study, to what extent ChatGPT could be prompted to solve the FCI as if it were a student having a different force- and mechanics-related preconception (RQ3). In alignment with other research, we found that ChatGPT could accurately solve the FCI. We furthermore found that prompting ChatGPT to respond to the inventory as if it belonged to a different cohort yielded no variance in responses, however, responding as if it had a certain preconception introduced much variance in responses that approximate real human responses on the FCI in some regards.

AB  - Introduction Generative AI tools can produce programming code that looks very similar to human-written code, which creates challenges in programming education. Students may use these tools inappropriately for their programming assignments, and there currently are not reliable methods to detect AI-generated code. It is important to address this issue to protect academic integrity while allowing the constructive use of AI tools. Previous studies have explored ways to detect AI-generated text, such as analyzing structural differences, embedding watermarks, examining specific features, or using fine-tuned language models. However, certain techniques, like prompt engineering, can make AI-generated code harder to identify.Methods To tackle this problem, this article suggests a new approach for instructors to handle programming assignment integrity. The idea is for instructors to use generative AI tools themselves to create example AI-generated submissions (pseudo-AI submissions) for each task. These pseudo-AI submissions, shared along with the task instructions, act as reference solutions for students. In the presence of pseudo-AI submissions, students are made aware that submissions resembling these examples are easily identifiable and will likely be flagged for lack of originality. On one side, this transparency removes the perceived advantage of using generative AI tools to complete assignments, as their output would closely match the provided examples, making it obvious to instructors. On the other side, the presence of these pseudo-AI submissions reinforces the expectation for students to produce unique and personalized work, motivating them to engage more deeply with the material and rely on their own problem-solving skills.Results A user study indicates that this method can detect AI-generated code with over 96% accuracy.Discussion The analysis of results shows that pseudo-AI submissions created using AI tools do not closely resemble student-written code, suggesting that the framework does not hinder students from writing their own unique solutions. Differences in areas such as expression assignments, use of language features, readability, efficiency, conciseness, and clean coding practices further distinguish pseudo-AI submissions from student work.

AB  - Digital pathology has transformed the traditional pathology practice of analyzing tissue under a microscope into a computer vision workfiow. Whole-slide imaging allows pathologists to view and analyze microscopic images on a computer monitor, enabling computational pathology. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), computational pathology has emerged as a promising field in recent years. Recently, task-specific AI/ML (eg, convolutional neural networks) has risen to the forefront, achieving above-human performance in many imageprocessing and computer vision tasks. The performance of task-specific AI/ML models depends on the availability of many annotated training datasets, which presents a rate-limiting factor for AI/ML development in pathology. Task-specific AI/ML models cannot benefit from multimodal data and lack generalization, eg, the AI models often struggle to generalize to new datasets or unseen variations in image acquisition, staining techniques, or tissue types. The 2020s are witnessing the rise of foundation models and generative AI. A foundation model is a large AI model trained using sizable data, which is later adapted (or fine-tuned) to perform different tasks using a modest amount of task-specific annotated data. These AI models provide in-context learning, can selfcorrect mistakes, and promptly adjust to user feedback. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent advances in computational pathology enabled by task-specific AI, their challenges and limitations, and then introduce various foundation models. We propose to create a pathologyspecific generative AI based on multimodal foundation models and present its potentially transformative role in digital pathology. We describe different use cases, delineating how it could serve as an expert companion of pathologists and help them efficiently and objectively perform routine laboratory tasks, including quantifying image analysis, generating pathology reports, diagnosis, and prognosis. We also outline the potential role that foundation models and generative AI can play in standardizing the pathology laboratory workfiow, education, and training.(c) 2023 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.

AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini, has significantly impacted the educational landscape, offering unique opportunities for learning and assessment. In the realm of written assessment grading, traditionally viewed as a laborious and subjective process, this study sought to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of these LLMs in evaluating the achievement of learning outcomes across different cognitive domains in a scientific inquiry course on sports physiology. Human graders and three LLMs, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Gemini, were tasked with scoring submitted student assignments according to a set of rubrics aligned with various cognitive domains, namely "Understand," "Analyze," and "Evaluate" from the revised Bloom's taxonomy and "Scientific Inquiry Competency." Our findings revealed that while LLMs demonstrated some level of competency, they do not yet meet the assessment standards of human graders. Specifically, interrater reliability (percentage agreement and correlation analysis) between human graders was superior as compared to between two grading rounds for each LLM, respectively. Furthermore, concordance and correlation between human and LLM graders were mostly moderate to poor in terms of overall scores and across the pre-specified cognitive domains. The results suggest a future where AI could complement human expertise in educational assessment but underscore the importance of adaptive learning by educators and continuous improvement in current AI technologies to fully realize this potential. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini has offered new learning and assessment opportunities to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with education. This study evaluated the accuracy of LLMs in assessing an assignment from a course on sports physiology. Concordance and correlation between human graders and LLMs were mostly moderate to poor. The findings suggest AI's potential to complement human expertise in educational assessment alongside the need for adaptive learning by educators.

AB  - The rapid advancement of generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and ChatGPT presents transformative opportunities for the construction industry. This study investigates their integration across education, training, and professional practice to address skill gaps and inefficiencies. While AI's potential in construction has been highlighted, limited attention has been given to synchronising academic curricula, workforce development, and industry practices. This research seeks to fill that gap by evaluating AI adoption through a mixed and multi-stage methodology, including theoretical conceptualisation, case studies, content analysis and application of strategic frameworks such as scenario planning, SWOT analysis, and PESTEL frameworks. The findings show AI tools enhance foundational learning and critical thinking in education but often fail to develop job-ready skills. Training programmes improve task-specific competencies with immersive simulations and predictive analytics but neglect strategic leadership skills. Professional practice benefits from AI-driven resource optimisation and collaboration tools but faces barriers like regulatory and interoperability challenges. By aligning theoretical education with practical training and strategic professional development, this research highlights the potential to create a future-ready workforce. The study provides actionable recommendations for integrating AI across domains. These findings contribute to understanding AI's transformative role in construction, offering a baseline for effective and responsible adoption.

AB  - This mixed-methods pilot study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT 3.5, to assist communication and public relations students in improving academic writing, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and coherence-skills aligned with cognitive load theory. An analysis of 60 abstracts (30 student-drafted abstracts and 30 AI-augmented abstracts) through qualitative and quantitative methods revealed modest enhancements. Two blinded expert evaluators identified statistically significant improvements in clarity and conciseness (Evaluator 1: p = 0.0024; Evaluator 2: p = 0.0462), although evaluator variability highlighted assessment subjectivity. Without a control group, causal claims are limited, and training sessions may have enhanced students' proficiency with ChatGPT, complicating attribution. The students perceived greater benefits (mean improvement = 1.2) than the evaluators confirmed (mean = 0.52), suggesting potential overconfidence. Risks, including overreliance on AI and threats to originality, underscore the need for ethical guidelines, such as critical evaluation training. Owing to its small, homogeneous sample size and short duration, this study lacks demographic diversity and longitudinal insight, thus necessitating broader, long-term research.

AB  - People with impaired decision-making capacity enjoy the same rights to access technology as people with full capacity. Our paper looks at realising this right in the specific contexts of artificial intelligence (AI) and mental capacity legislation. Ireland's Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, 2015 commenced in April 2023 and refers to 'assistive technology' within its 'communication' criterion for capacity. We explore the potential benefits and risks of AI in assisting communication under this legislation and seek to identify principles or lessons which might be applicable in other jurisdictions. We focus especially on Ireland's provisions for advance healthcare directives because previous research demonstrates that common barriers to advance care planning include (i) lack of knowledge and skills, (ii) fear of starting conversations about advance care planning, and (iii) lack of time. We hypothesise that these barriers might be overcome, at least in part, by using generative AI which is already freely available worldwide. Bodies such as the United Nations have produced guidance about ethical use of AI and these guide our analysis. One of the ethical risks in the current context is that AI would reach beyond communication and start to influence the content of decisions, especially among people with impaired decision-making capacity. For example, when we asked one AI model to 'Make me an advance healthcare directive', its initial response did not explicitly suggest content for the directive, but it did suggest topics that might be included, which could be seen as setting an agenda. One possibility for circumventing this and other shortcomings, such as concerns around accuracy of information, is to look to foundational models of AI. With their capabilities to be trained and fine-tuned to downstream tasks, purpose-designed AI models could be adapted to provide education about capacity legislation, facilitate patient and staff interaction, and allow interactive updates by healthcare professionals. These measures could optimise the benefits of AI and minimise risks. Similar efforts have been made to use AI more responsibly in healthcare by training large language models to answer healthcare questions more safely and accurately. We highlight the need for open discussion about optimising the potential of AI while minimising risks in this population.

AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs) in medical education offers both opportunities and challenges. While these artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools can enhance access to information and support critical thinking, they also pose risks like potential overreliance and ethical concerns. To ensure ethical use, students and instructors must recognize the limitations of LLMs, maintain academic integrity, and handle data cautiously, and instructors should prioritize content quality over AI detection methods. LLMs can be used as supplementary aids rather than primary educational resources, with a focus on enhancing accessibility and equity and fostering a culture of feedback. Institutions should create guidelines that align with their unique educational values, providing clear frameworks that support responsible LLM usage while addressing risks associated with AI in education. Such guidelines should reflect the institution's pedagogical mission, whether centered on clinical practice, research, or a mix of both, and should be adaptable to evolving educational technologies.

AB  - Introduction/objective: Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) present significant caregiving challenges, with increasing burdens on informal caregivers. This study examines the potential of AI-driven Large Language Models (LLMs) in developing digital caregiving strategies for AD/ADRD. The objectives include analyzing existing caregiving education materials (CEMs) and mobile application descriptions (MADs) and aligning key caregiving tasks with digital functions across different stages of disease progression. Methods: We analyzed 38 CEMs from the National Library of Medicine's MedlinePlus, along with associated hyperlinked web resources, and 57 MADs focused on AD digital caregiving. Using ChatGPT 3.5, essential caregiving tasks were extracted and matched with digital functionalities suitable for each stage of AD progression, while also highlighting digital literacy requirements for caregivers. Results: The analysis categorizes AD caregiving into 4 stages-Pre-Clinical, Mild, Moderate, and Severe-identifying key tasks, such as behavior monitoring, daily assistance, direct supervision, and ensuring a safe environment. These tasks were supported by digital aids, including memory- enhancing apps, Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking, voice-controlled devices, and advanced GPS tracking for comprehensive care. Additionally, 6 essential digital literacy skills for AD/ADRD caregiving were identified: basic digital skills, communication, information management, safety and privacy, healthcare knowledge, and caregiver coordination, highlighting the need for tailored training. Conclusion: The findings advocate for an LLM-driven strategy in designing digital caregiving interventions, particularly emphasizing a novel paradigm in AD/ADRD support, offering adaptive assistance that evolves with caregivers' needs, thereby enhancing their shared decision-making and patient care capabilities.

AB  - Careless speech is a new type of harm created by large language models (LLM) that poses cumulative, long-term risks to science, education and shared social truth in democratic societies. LLMs produce responses that are plausible, helpful and confident, but that contain factual inaccuracies, misleading references and biased information. These subtle mistruths are poised to cumulatively degrade and homogenize knowledge over time. This article examines the existence and feasibility of a legal duty for LLM providers to create models that 'tell the truth'. We argue that LLM providers should be required to mitigate careless speech and better align their models with truth through open, democratic processes. We define careless speech against 'ground truth' in LLMs and related risks including hallucinations, misinformation and disinformation. We assess the existence of truth-related obligations in EU human rights law and the Artificial Intelligence Act, Digital Services Act, Product Liability Directive and Artificial Intelligence Liability Directive. Current frameworks contain limited, sector-specific truth duties. Drawing on duties in science and academia, education, archives and libraries, and a German case in which Google was held liable for defamation caused by autocomplete, we propose a pathway to create a legal truth duty for providers of narrow- and general-purpose LLMs.

AB  - Identifying and resolving logic errors can be one of the most frustrating challenges for novices programmers. Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler or interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain conditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior - in other cases, the issue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors can be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed by automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically detecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for novices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising performance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining code. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with the next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors relate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to analysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly explanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of introductory computing students (.. = 964) solving the same error detection task. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we observe significant improvement in logic error identification between the previous and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations significantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be integrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for supporting students when learning programming.

AB  - Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), presents innovative opportunities to enhance software engineering education. Open source LLMs such as LLaMA and Mistral leverage the potential of generative AI offering distinct advantages over proprietary options including transparency, customizability, collaboration, and cost savings. This paper develops a catalog of LLM prompt examples tailored for software engineering training, mapped to knowledge areas from the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBoK) framework. Example prompts demonstrate LLMs' capabilities in eliciting requirements, diagram generation, API simulation, effort estimation through role-playing, and other areas. The methodology involves evaluating prompt responses from ChatGPT, Mistral, and LLaMA on representative tasks. Quantitative and qualitative analysis assesses quality, usefulness, and correctness. Findings show ChatGPT and Mistral outperforming LLaMA overall, but no model perfectly executes complex interactions. We examine implications and challenges of integrating open source LLMs into classrooms, emphasizing the need for oversight, verification, and prompt design aligned with pedagogical objectives.

AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare, particularly in nephrology, represents a significant advancement in applying advanced technology to patient care, medical research, and education. These advanced models have progressed from simple text processors to tools capable of deep language understanding, offering innovative ways to handle health-related data, thus improving medical practice efficiency and effectiveness. A significant challenge in medical applications of LLMs is their imperfect accuracy and/or tendency to produce hallucinations-outputs that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. This issue is particularly critical in healthcare, where precision is essential, as inaccuracies can undermine the reliability of these models in crucial decision-making processes. To overcome these challenges, various strategies have been developed. One such strategy is prompt engineering, like the chain-of-thought approach, which directs LLMs towards more accurate responses by breaking down the problem into intermediate steps or reasoning sequences. Another one is the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy, which helps address hallucinations by integrating external data, enhancing output accuracy and relevance. Hence, RAG is favored for tasks requiring up-to-date, comprehensive information, such as in clinical decision making or educational applications. In this article, we showcase the creation of a specialized ChatGPT model integrated with a RAG system, tailored to align with the KDIGO 2023 guidelines for chronic kidney disease. This example demonstrates its potential in providing specialized, accurate medical advice, marking a step towards more reliable and efficient nephrology practices.

AB  - AI-systems that are based on large language models, such as ChatGPT, have quickly increased their prowess over the last year, and at the same time became readily available. As of now, many disciplines gain experience in using tools such as ChatGPT in a professional setting - and software engineering is no exception. Just as with any new kind of tooling, it is to be expected that in the era of ChatGPT, some traditional skills of the discipline will become rather obsolete, while at the same time new skill sets emerge that will be required from future professionals. Therefore, as educators we must reconsider the skill set we aim at fostering in our software engineering students, and adapt our intended learning outcomes accordingly. Furthermore, we need to adapt both assessment strategies and the teaching and learning methods we employ, in order to provide our students with a study experience that adheres to the principle of constructive alignment.

AB  - Software assistants have significantly impacted software development for both practitioners and students, particularly in capstone projects. The effectiveness of these tools varies based on their knowledge sources; assistants with localized domain-specific knowledge may have limitations, while tools, such as ChatGPT, using broad datasets, might offer recommendations that do not always match the specific objectives of a capstone course. Addressing a gap in current educational technology, this article introduces an AI Knowledge Assistant specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools by enhancing the quality and relevance of large language models (LLMs). It achieves this through the innovative integration of contextual knowledge from a local "lessons learned" database tailored to the capstone course. We conducted a study with 150 students using the assistant during their capstone course. Integrated into the Kanban project tracking system, the assistant offered recommendations using different strategies: direct searches in the lessons learned database, direct queries to a generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model, query enrichment with lessons learned before submission to GPT and large language model meta AI (LLaMa) models, and query enhancement with Stack Overflow data before GPT processing. Survey results underscored a strong preference among students for direct LLM queries and those enriched with local repository insights, highlighting the assistant's practical value. Furthermore, our linguistic analysis conclusively demonstrated that texts generated by the LLM closely mirrored the linguistic standards and topical relevance of university course requirements. This alignment not only fosters a deeper understanding of course content but also significantly enhances the material's applicability to real-world scenarios.

AB  - BackgroundThe study explores the potential of ChatGPT, an advanced large language model (LLM) by OpenAI, in educating patients about meningioma, a common type of brain tumor. While ChatGPT has generated significant debate regarding its utility and ethics, its growing popularity suggests that patients may increasingly use such tools for medical information. The study specifically examines how patients who have undergone radiation therapy for meningioma perceive the information generated by ChatGPT, integrating both patient feedback and clinical assessment.MethodsEight meningioma-related questions on diagnosis, treatment options, and radiation therapy were posed to ChatGPT 4. A questionnaire with these responses and feedback items was developed to assess utility, accuracy, clarity, and alignment with patients' experiences. Nine clinicians first rated each response's relevance, correctness, and completeness on a five-point Likert scale. Subsequently, 28 patients with meningioma completed the questionnaire during their first follow-up visit (three months post-radiation therapy). Finally, the same questions were presented to three other large language models (ChatGPT 4o mini, Gemini Free, Gemini Advanced), and seven blinded clinicians rated each model's responses before selecting the most accurate, eloquent, and comprehensive overall.ResultsThe study cohort included 28 meningioma patients, mostly female, with a median age of 60 years. Most patients found the information clear, accurate, and reflective of their experiences, with 60% willing to use ChatGPT for future inquiries. Clinicians rated the relevance and correctness of the information highly, although completeness was rated slightly lower, particularly for questions about specific radiation therapy details and side effects. ChatGPT 4 and its newer version ChatGPT 4o mini received the highest, nearly identical scores among the four LLMs evaluated, while Gemini Free scored the lowest in clinician assessments.ConclusionsChatGPT demonstrates potential as a supplementary educational tool for meningioma patients, though some areas may require improvement, particularly in providing comprehensive information. The study highlights the potential for integrating AI in patient education, while also noting the need for clinical oversight to ensure accuracy and completeness.Trial registration: LMU ethics vote nr.: 23-0742ConclusionsChatGPT demonstrates potential as a supplementary educational tool for meningioma patients, though some areas may require improvement, particularly in providing comprehensive information.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have sparked extensive discourse within the medical education community, spurring both excitement and apprehension. Written from the perspective of medical students, this editorial offers insights gleaned through immersive interactions with ChatGPT, contextualized by ongoing research into the imminent role of LLMs in health care. Three distinct positive use cases for ChatGPT were identified: facilitating differential diagnosis brainstorming, providing interactive practice cases, and aiding in multiple-choice question review. These use cases can effectively help students learn foundational medical knowledge during the preclinical curriculum while reinforcing the learning of core Entrustable Professional Activities. Simultaneously, we highlight key limitations of LLMs in medical education, including their insufficient ability to teach the integration of contextual and external information, comprehend sensory and nonverbal cues, cultivate rapport and interpersonal interaction, and align with overarching medical education and patient care goals. Through interacting with LLMs to augment learning during medical school, students can gain an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. This understanding will be pivotal as we navigate a health care landscape increasingly intertwined with LLMs and artificial intelligence.

AB  - There is a constant need for educators to develop and maintain effective up-to-date assessments. While there is a growing body of research in computing education on utilizing large language models (LLMs) in generation and engagement with coding exercises, the use of LLMs for generating programming MCQs has not been extensively explored. We analyzed the capability of GPT-4 to produce multiple-choice questions (MCQs) aligned with specific learning objectives (LOs) from Python programming classes in higher education. Specifically, we developed an LLM-powered (GPT-4) system for generation of MCQs from high-level course context and module-level LOs. We evaluated 651 LLM-generated and 449 human-crafted MCQs aligned to 246 LOs from 6 Python courses. We found that GPT-4 was capable of producing MCQs with clear language, a single correct choice, and high-quality distractors. We also observed that the generated MCQs appeared to be wellaligned with the LOs. Our findings can be leveraged by educators wishing to take advantage of the state-of-the-art generative models to support MCQ authoring efforts.

AB  - Introduction: AI-powered platforms have gained prominence in medical education and training, offering diverse applications from surgical performance assessment to exam preparation. This research paper examines the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), including Llama 2, Google Bard, Bing Chat, and ChatGPT-3.5, in answering multiple-choice questions of the Clinical Problem Solving (CPS) paper of the Multi-Specialty Recruitment Assessment (MSRA) exam.Methods: Using a dataset of 100 CPS questions from ten subject categories, we assessed the LLMs' performance against medical doctors preparing for the exam.Results: Results showed that Bing Chat outperformed all other LLMs and even surpassed human users from the Qbank question bank. Conversely, Llama 2's performance was inferior to human users. Google Bard and ChatGPT 3.5 did not exhibit statistically significant differences in correct response rates compared to human candidates. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated Bing Chat's significant superiority over Llama 2, Google Bard, and ChatGPT 3.5. However, no significant differences were found between Llama 2 and Google Bard, Llama 2, and ChatGPT3.5, and Google Bard and ChatGPT-3.5.Discussion: Freely available LLMs have already demonstrated that they can perform as well or even outperform human users in answering MSRA exam questions. Bing Chat emerged as a particularly strong performer. The study also highlights the potential for enhancing LLMs' medical knowledge acquisition through tailored finetuning. Medical knowledge tailored LLMs such as Med-PaLM, have already shown promising results. Conclusion: We provided valuable insights into LLMs' competence in answering medical MCQs and their potential integration into medical education and assessment processes.

AB  - High-quality science assessments are multi-dimensional. They promote disciplinary practices, core ideas, cross-cutting concepts, and science sense-making. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), specifically multimodal large language models (MLLMs), to annotate and provide improvement ideas for K-12 science assessments. The AI-generated annotations critique how the assessments align with the three dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and suggest ideas to elicit students' science sense-making. We outline our process with various prompting strategies: few-shot and zero-shot learning (prompting with and without examples), chain of thought (eliciting the MLLM's reasoning), and sampling strategies (outputting high or low level of randomness). Overall, the AI annotations can reason about the alignment between the assessments and NGSS dimensions and overlap with annotations from K-12 educators. Annotations generated with few-shot learning generally score higher overall and provide more details than zero-shot prompts. Further, interviews with science teachers reveal that the MLLM annotations can support teachers' reflection on instructional practices and assessment revision. We discuss the application of MLLMs to develop three-dimensional science assessments.

AB  - This study explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in designing educational board games, and be deployed as objects-to-think-with It aims to guide educators through three pivotal design phases: ideation, where ChatGPT suggests themes and mechanisms aligned with learning goals; customization, providing templates for tailored games; and feedback on prototypes to enhance game components and mechanisms. We also compared the use of ChatGPT in a game ideation process, contrasting with a traditional game design approach. Although offering a dynamic platform blending computational prowess and creativity, ChatGPT and similar LLMs pose challenges. They can exhibit biases from training datasets, affecting game inclusivity. They may also generate inaccurate details, propose counter-intuitive rules, and misinterpret feedback, resulting in unintended dynamics. Addressing these challenges necessitates a designer critical evaluation of LLM suggestions and the infusion of human creativity and intuition. This research advances discussions on AI in education by highlighting both the potential and the challenges of employing such innovative tools in developing serious games, aiming to foster a balanced and informed approach to integrating LLMs in educational game design.

AB  - Background: Radiologists increasingly use artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize workflows. However, many lack the technical skills to effectively apply machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, limiting the accessibility of these methods to radiology researchers who could otherwise benefit from them. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, may serve as virtual advisors, offering tailored algorithm recommendations for specific research needs. This study evaluates GPT-4o's effectiveness as a recommender system to enhance radiologists' understanding and implementation of AI in research. Intervention: GPT-4o was used to recommend ML and DL algorithms based on specific details provided by researchers, including dataset characteristics, modality types, data sizes, and research objectives. The model acted as a virtual advisor, guiding researchers in selecting the most appropriate models for their studies. Methods: The study systematically evaluated GPT-4o's recommendations for clarity, task alignment, model diversity, and baseline selection. Responses were graded to assess the model's ability to meet the needs of radiology researchers. Results: GPT-4o effectively recommended appropriate ML and DL algorithms for various radiology tasks, including segmentation, classification, and regression in medical imaging. The model suggested a diverse range of established and innovative algorithms, such as U-Net, Random Forest, Attention U-Net, and EfficientNet, aligning well with accepted practices. Conclusion: GPT-4o shows promise as a valuable tool for radiologists and early career researchers by providing clear and relevant AI and ML algorithm recommendations. Its ability to bridge the knowledge gap in AI implementation could democratize access to advanced technologies, fostering innovation and improving radiology research quality. Further studies should explore integrating LLMs into routine workflows and their role in ongoing professional development.

AB  - We propose a collaborative hybrid (human plus artificial intelligence) learning, which enhances learning impact with additional elements. These elements are: collective intelligence, created by integrating large language models (LLMs) into argumentation to strengthen students in various roles; adversarial learning, where competition between students is built on the principles of generative adversarial networks around complex decision objectives (dilemmas) towards developing resilience skills. We conduct an experiment, structured as a series of intellectual sparring between teams of players. The scenario of sparring evolved from classical disputes to technologically augmented competitions. The core hypotheses, "positive impact of adversarial training" and "game-changer role of LLMs in argumentation", have been confirmed. An important conclusion is that the added value of LLM tools strongly depends on how professionally they are used. Achieved results are presented as a contribution to collaborative hybrid learning using artificial intelligence as a personal digital assistant.

AB  - The transformative influence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), notably large language models (LLMs), has significantly reshaped the software engineering (SE) landscape, impacting various aspects of software development within industry and academia. The imperative to integrate generative AI into educational programs arises from the necessity to furnish graduates with contemporary methodologies that enhance software quality and streamline development processes. Nevertheless, a research gap exists concerning the systematic integration of established SE education guidelines with specific course contexts to strengthen SE education through incorporating generative AI. In response to this gap, our study presents a vision for integrating generative AI into SE education, with a particular emphasis on practical integration strategies aimed at endowing students with essential competencies tailored for contemporary software development. Aligning our vision with the knowledge domains within SE education, we delineate its application across specific areas such as code generation, auto test case completion, and others. The overall objective of these proposed initiatives is to furnish students in SE with an updated and immersive learning experience, thereby addressing the evolving demands of the field.

AB  - BackgroundThe large language model ChatGPT can now accept image input with the GPT4-vision (GPT4V) version. We aimed to compare the performance of GPT4V to pretrained U-Net and vision transformer (ViT) models for the identification of the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).MethodsPaired coregistered MR images with and without progression were provided as input to ChatGPT4V in a zero-shot experiment to identify radiologic progression. Its performance was compared to pretrained U-Net and ViT models. Accuracy was the primary evaluation metric and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated by bootstrapping. We included 170 patients with MS (50 males, 120 females), aged 21-74 years (mean 42.3), imaged at a single institution from 2019 to 2021, each with 2-5 MRI studies (496 in total).ResultsOne hundred seventy patients were included, 110 for training, 30 for tuning, and 30 for testing; 100 unseen paired images were randomly selected from the test set for evaluation. Both U-Net and ViT had 94% (95% CI: 89-98%) accuracy while GPT4V had 85% (77-91%). GPT4V gave cautious nonanswers in six cases. GPT4V had precision (specificity), recall (sensitivity), and F1 score of 89% (75-93%), 92% (82-98%), 91 (82-97%) compared to 100% (100-100%), 88 (78-96%), and 0.94 (88-98%) for U-Net and 94% (87-100%), 94 (88-100%), and 94 (89-98%) for ViT.ConclusionThe performance of GPT4V combined with its accessibility suggests has the potential to impact AI radiology research. However, misclassified cases and overly cautious non-answers confirm that it is not yet ready for clinical use.Relevance statementGPT4V can identify the radiologic progression of MS in a simplified experimental setting. However, GPT4V is not a medical device, and its widespread availability highlights the need for caution and education for lay users, especially those with limited access to expert healthcare.Key PointsWithout fine-tuning or the need for prior coding experience, GPT4V can perform a zero-shot radiologic change detection task with reasonable accuracy.However, in absolute terms, in a simplified "spot the difference" medical imaging task, GPT4V was inferior to state-of-the-art computer vision methods.GPT4V's performance metrics were more similar to the ViT than the U-net.This is an exploratory experimental study and GPT4V is not intended for use as a medical device.

AB  - BackgroundIn computing education, educators are constantly faced with the challenge of developing new curricula, including learning objectives (LOs), while ensuring that existing courses remain relevant. Large language models (LLMs) were shown to successfully generate a wide spectrum of natural language artefacts in computing education.ObjectivesThe objective of this study is to evaluate if it is feasible for a state-of-the-art LLM to support curricular design by proposing lists of high-quality LOs.MethodsWe propose a simple LLM-powered framework for the automatic generation of LOs. Two human evaluators compare the automatically generated LOs to the human-crafted ones in terms of their alignment with course goals, meeting the SMART criteria, mutual overlap, and appropriateness of ordering.ResultsWe found that automatically generated LOs are comparable to LOs authored by instructors in many respects, including being measurable and relevant while exhibiting some limitations (e.g., sometimes not being specific or achievable). LOs were also comparable in their alignment with the high-level course goals. Finally, auto-generated LOs were often deemed to be better organised (order, non-overlap) than the human-authored ones.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that LLM could support educators in designing their courses by providing reasonable suggestions for LOs.

AB  - In modern education, individualized learning environments play a vital role by allowing learners to tailor their learning paths based on personal needs, interests, and abilities. Achieving effective individualization relies on dynamic adaptation of the learning path, typically facilitated by recommender systems. These systems offer personalized suggestions, commonly employing content-based or collaborative filtering approaches. However, traditional recommender systems often lack consideration of the semantics of learning elements. To address this limitation, ontology-based recommender systems integrate semantic modeling, establishing additional connections within a domain to enhance precision and context in recommendations. Notably, these systems mitigate the cold start problem and are particularly advantageous in learning environments with limited data. While videos are prevalent in learning platforms, their unstructured nature poses challenges for processing. This paper introduces an innovative approach, leveraging Large Language Models, specifically GPT, to extract metadata from learning videos. The proposed method intelligently augments videos and links them to a domain ontology, enabling the integration of videos into ontology-based recommender systems. The application of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in software engineering education, showcasing its potential to enhance individualized learning experiences in specific domains. The presented method offers an automated alternative to manual video processing, aligning with the evolving landscape of education technology.

AB  - Despite well-designed curriculum materials, teachers often face significant challenges in their implementation due to the diverse learning needs present in classrooms. This paper examines whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to enhance K-12 math education by facilitating the creation of high-quality curriculum scaffolds that reflect expert teachers' strategies. Through an in-depth qualitative analysis with experienced middle-school math teachers, we identified crucial instructional supplements such as warm-up tasks and example-problem pairs that are essential for engaging students and supporting diverse learner needs. Building on these insights, we developed ScaffGen, an LLM-powered tool designed to generate curriculum-aligned educational materials. While LLMs alone may fall short in educational contexts, when enhanced with expert teacher insights, they can effectively emulate the cognitive processes required for pedagogically robust material creation. We plan to assess the effectiveness of these AI-generated materials through rigorous evaluations involving comparisons with expert-written benchmarks and field tests in classroom settings. This research highlights the potential of LLMs to mimic expert decision-making in educational material creation, offering significant implications for scalable instructional support.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become widely applied across many fields, including medical education. Content validation and its answers are based on training datasets and the optimization of each model. The accuracy of large language model (LLMs) in basic medical examinations and factors related to their accuracy have also been explored. Objective: We evaluated factors associated with the accuracy of LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing) in answering multiple-choice questions from basic medical science examinations. Methods: We used questions that were closely aligned with the content and topic distribution of Thailand's Step 1 National Medical Licensing Examination. Variables such as the difficulty index, discrimination index, and question characteristics were collected. These questions were then simultaneously input into ChatGPT (with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard, and their responses were recorded. The accuracy of these LLMs and the associated factors were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. This analysis aimed to assess the effect of various factors on model accuracy, with results reported as odds ratios (ORs). Results: The study revealed that GPT-4 was the top-performing model, with an overall accuracy of 89.07% (95% CI 84.76%-92.41%), significantly outperforming the others (P<.001). Microsoft Bing followed with an accuracy of 83.69% (95% CI 78.85%-87.80%), GPT-3.5 at 67.02% (95% CI 61.20%-72.48%), and Google Bard at 63.83% (95% CI 57.92%-69.44%). The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed a correlation between question difficulty and model performance, with GPT-4 demonstrating the strongest association. Interestingly, no significant correlation was found between model accuracy and question length, negative wording, clinical scenarios, or the discrimination index for most models, except for Google Bard, which showed varying correlations. Conclusions: The GPT-4 and Microsoft Bing models demonstrated equal and superior accuracy compared to GPT-3.5 and Google Bard in the domain of basic medical science. The accuracy of these models was significantly influenced by the item's difficulty index, indicating that the LLMs are more accurate when answering easier questions. This suggests that the more accurate models, such as GPT-4 and Bing, can be valuable tools for understanding and learning basic medical science concepts.

AB  - Academic advising plays a crucial role in fostering student success. However, challenges such as limited advisor availability can hinder effective support. Generative AI, particularly AI-powered chatbots, offers the potential to enhance student advising in higher education by providing personalized guidance. These technologies help college students find the information and resources needed to create degree plans aligned with their academic goals. This research introduces ARGObot, an intelligent advising system that facilitates student navigation of university policies through automated interpretation of the student handbook as its primary knowledge base. ARGObot enhances accessibility to critical academic policies and procedures, supporting incoming students' success through personalized guidance. Our system integrates a multifunctional agent enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture employs multiple external tools to enhance its capabilities: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system accesses verified university sources; email integration facilitates Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interaction; and a web search function expands the system's knowledge base beyond predefined constraints. This approach enables the system to provide contextually relevant and verified responses to various student queries. This architecture evolved from our initial implementation based on Gemini 1 Pro, which revealed significant limitations due to its lack of agent-based functionality, resulting in hallucination issues and irrelevant responses. Subsequent evaluation demonstrated that our enhanced version, integrating GPT-4 with the text-embedding-ada-002 model, achieved superior performance across all metrics. This paper also presents a comparative analysis of both implementations, highlighting the architectural improvements and their impact on system performance.

AB  - This paper seeks to contribute to the emergent literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy in higher education. Specifically, this convergent, mixed methods case study explores the impact of employing Generative AI (GenAI) tools and cyber-social teaching methods on the development of higher education students' AI literacy. Three 8-week courses on advanced digital technologies for education in a graduate program in the College of Education at a mid-western US university served as the study sites. Data were based on 37 participants' experiences with two different types of GenAI tools-a GenAI reviewer and GenAI image generator platforms. The application of the GenAI review tool relied on precision fine-tuning and transparency in AI-human interactions, while the AI image generation tools facilitated the participants' reflection on their learning experiences and AI's role in education. Students' interaction with both tools was designed to foster their learning regarding GenAI's strengths and limitations, and their responsible application in educational contexts. The findings revealed that the participants appeared to feel more comfortable using GenAI tools after their course experiences. The results also point to the students' enhanced ability to understand and critically assess the value of AI applications in education. This study contributes to existing work on AI in higher education by introducing a novel pedagogical approach for AI literacy development showcasing the synergy between humans and artificial intelligence.

AB  - Chatbots are AI-powered programs designed to replicate human conversation. They are capable of performing a wide range of tasks, including answering questions, offering directions, controlling smart home thermostats, and playing music, among other functions. ChatGPT is a popular AI-based chatbot that generates meaningful responses to queries, aiding people in learning. While some individuals support ChatGPT, others view it as a disruptive tool in the field of education. Discussions about this tool can be found across different social media platforms. Analyzing the sentiment of such social media data, which comprises people's opinions, is crucial for assessing public sentiment regarding the success and shortcomings of such tools. This study performs a sentiment analysis and topic modeling on ChatGPT-based tweets. ChatGPT-based tweets are the author's extracted tweets from Twitter using ChatGPT hashtags, where users share their reviews and opinions about ChatGPT, providing a reference to the thoughts expressed by users in their tweets. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach is employed to identify the most frequently discussed topics in relation to ChatGPT tweets. For the sentiment analysis, a deep transformer-based Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with three dense layers of neural networks is proposed. Additionally, machine and deep learning models with fine-tuned parameters are utilized for a comparative analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed BERT model, achieving an accuracy of 96.49%.

KW  - Automatic scoring
KW  - Large language models
KW  - Human alignment
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in performing automatic scoring for constructed response assessments. While constructed responses graded by humans are usually based on given grading rubrics, the methods by which LLMs assign scores remain largely unclear. It is also uncertain how closely AI's scoring process mirrors that of humans or if it adheres to the same grading criteria. To address this gap, this paper uncovers the grading rubrics that LLMs used to score students' written responses to science tasks and their alignment with human scores. We also examine whether enhancing the alignments can improve scoring accuracy. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate analytic rubrics that they use to assign scores and study the alignment gap with human grading rubrics. Based on a series of experiments with various configurations of LLM settings, we reveal a notable alignment gap between human and LLM graders. While LLMs can adapt quickly to scoring tasks, they often resort to shortcuts, bypassing deeper logical reasoning expected in human grading. We found that incorporating high-quality analytical rubrics designed to reflect human grading logic can mitigate this gap and enhance LLMs' scoring accuracy. These results underscore the need for a nuanced approach when applying LLMs in science education and highlight the importance of aligning LLM outputs with human expectations to ensure efficient and accurate automatic scoring.

AB  - AI agents based on multimodal large language models (LLMs) are expected to revolutionize human-computer interaction, and offer more personalized assistant services across various domains like healthcare, education, manufacturing, and entertainment. Deploying LLM agents in 6G networks enables users to access previously expensive AI assistant services via mobile devices democratically, thereby reducing interaction latency and better preserving user privacy. Nevertheless, the limited capacity of mobile devices constrains the effectiveness of deploying and executing local LLMs, which necessitates offloading complex tasks to global LLMs running on edge servers during long-horizon interactions. In this article, we propose a split learning system for LLM agents in 6G networks, leveraging the collaboration between mobile devices and edge servers, where multiple LLMs with different roles are distributed across mobile devices and edge servers to perform user-agent interactive tasks collaboratively. In the proposed system, LLM agents are split into perception, grounding, and alignment modules, facilitating inter-module communications to meet extended user requirements on 6G network functions, including integrated sensing and communication, digital twins, and task-oriented communications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel model caching algorithm for LLMs within the proposed system to improve model utilization in context, thus reducing network costs of the collaborative mobile and edge LLM agents.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed widespread application across diverse domains, with education being a prominent focus for enhancing learning outcomes and tailoring educational approaches. Transformer models, exemplified by BERT, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This research scrutinizes the current landscape of AI in education, emphasizing the utilization of transformer models. Specifically, the research delves into the influence of AI tools facilitating text generation through input prompts, with a notable instance being the GPT-4 model developed by OpenAI. The study employs pre-trained transformer models to discern whether a given text originates from AI or human sources. Notably, BERT emerges as the most effective model, fine-tuned using a dataset comprising abstracts authored by humans and those generated by AI. The outcomes reveal a heightened accuracy in distinguishing AI-generated text. These findings bear significance for the educational realm, suggesting that while endorsing the use of such tools for learning, vigilance is warranted to identify potential misuse or instances where students should independently develop their reasoning skills. Nevertheless, ethical considerations must be paramount when employing such methodologies. We have highlighted vulnerabilities concerning the potential bias of AI models towards non-native English speakers, stemming from possible deficiencies in vocabulary and grammatical structure. Additionally, users must ensure that there is no complete reliance on these systems to ascertain students' performance. Further research is imperative to unleash the full potential of AI in education and address ethical considerations tied to its application.

AB  - Since the conception of Large Language Models (LLMs), their areas of application have increased significantly over time. This is due to their nature of being able to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks (like question answering, text generation, text summarization, text classification etc.), which gives them flexibility in a multitude of spaces, including in Educational AI (EdAI). Despite their incredible wide range of use, LLMs are typically applied to generative AI, from text to image generation. This paper aims to apply LLMs for a classification task in EdAI, by reproposing the original PreSS (Predicting Student Success) model which makes use of more traditional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for predicting CS1 students at risk of failing or dropping out. There are two main goals for this work: the first is to identify the best and most accurate method to re-purpose LLMs for a classification task; the second is to explore and access the explainability of the model outputs. For the former we investigate different techniques for using LLMs like Few-Shot Prompting, FineTuning and Transfer Learning using Gemma 2B as base model along with two different kind of prompting techniques. For the latter we focus on attention scores of LLMs transformers, aiming to understanding what are the most important features that the model considers for generating the response. The obtained results are then compared with the previous PreSS model to evaluate whether LLMs can outperform traditional ML algorithms: this paper finds that Naive Bayes still outperforms all the others, once again confirmed as the best algorithm for predicting student success.

AB  - The possible applications of GenAI (Generative AI) in education alone are so manyfold and overwhelming that it is useful to have an overview of the many possibilities that are opening up. In this paper, we try to organize some of the low-hanging fruits that can help instructors, learners, and educational managers use GenAI applications to improve educational performance.
   For instructors, GenAI can help in gaining a deeper understanding of the topics to be taught, preparing educational materials, and facilitating the enactment phase in class. Learners can be assisted in getting personalized content and feedback, having GenAI as a participant in forums, or for self-reflection and emotions detection. Managers and other stakeholders can profit from Academic Analytics, bias detection, course repurposing, and many other uses.
   In this paper, we also present a use case detailing some initial actions we are implementing for a Programming with Java course. One action is to explicitly identify, in each problem set, the competencies being developed. Another one is the development of a chatbot, fine-tuned with the course material, which can be used by students as a tutor. The third action is to use a GenAI tool to generate questions aimed at assessing whether students truly grasp the programming project they have supposedly developed.
   AI is here to stay, in spite of the issues it opens up, and therefore it is never too early to start experimenting with it in practice.

AB  - Objectives To examine whether comfort with the use of ChatGPT in society differs from comfort with other uses of AI in society and to identify whether this comfort and other patient characteristics such as trust, privacy concerns, respect, and tech-savviness are associated with expected benefit of the use of ChatGPT for improving health.Materials and Methods We analyzed an original survey of U.S. adults using the NORC AmeriSpeak Panel (n = 1787). We conducted paired t-tests to assess differences in comfort with AI applications. We conducted weighted univariable regression and 2 weighted logistic regression models to identify predictors of expected benefit with and without accounting for trust in the health system.Results Comfort with the use of ChatGPT in society is relatively low and different from other, common uses of AI. Comfort was highly associated with expecting benefit. Other statistically significant factors in multivariable analysis (not including system trust) included feeling respected and low privacy concerns. Females, younger adults, and those with higher levels of education were less likely to expect benefits in models with and without system trust, which was positively associated with expecting benefits (P = 1.6 x 10-11). Tech-savviness was not associated with the outcome.Discussion Understanding the impact of large language models (LLMs) from the patient perspective is critical to ensuring that expectations align with performance as a form of calibrated trust that acknowledges the dynamic nature of trust.Conclusion Including measures of system trust in evaluating LLMs could capture a range of issues critical for ensuring patient acceptance of this technological innovation.

AB  - PurposeThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, in clinical medicine and medical education has gained significant attention due to their potential to support decision-making and improve patient care. However, there is a need to evaluate the benefits and limitations of these tools in specific clinical scenarios.MethodsThis study used a case study approach within the field of orthopaedic surgery. A clinical case report featuring a 53-year-old male with a femoral neck fracture was used as the basis for evaluation. ChatGPT, a large language model, was asked to respond to clinical questions related to the case. The responses generated by ChatGPT were evaluated qualitatively, considering their relevance, justification, and alignment with the responses of real clinicians. Alternative dialogue protocols were also employed to assess the impact of additional prompts and contextual information on ChatGPT responses.ResultsChatGPT generally provided clinically appropriate responses to the questions posed in the clinical case report. However, the level of justification and explanation varied across the generated responses. Occasionally, clinically inappropriate responses and inconsistencies were observed in the generated responses across different dialogue protocols and on separate days.ConclusionsThe findings of this study highlight both the potential and limitations of using ChatGPT in clinical practice. While ChatGPT demonstrated the ability to provide relevant clinical information, the lack of consistent justification and occasional clinically inappropriate responses raise concerns about its reliability. These results underscore the importance of careful consideration and validation when using AI tools in healthcare. Further research and clinician training are necessary to effectively integrate AI tools like ChatGPT, ensuring their safe and reliable use in clinical decision-making.

AB  - The manual assessment and grading of student writing is a time-consuming yet critical task for teachers. Recent developments in generative AI offer potential solutions to facilitate essay-scoring tasks for teachers. In our study, we evaluate the performance (e.g. alignment and reliability) of both open-source and closed-source LLMs in assessing German student essays, comparing their evaluations to those of 37 teachers across 10 pre-defined criteria (i.e., plot logic, expression). A corpus of 20 real-world essays from Year 7 and 8 students was analyzed using five LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, o1-preview, LLaMA 3-70B, and Mixtral 8x7B, aiming to provide in-depth insights into LLMs' scoring capabilities. Closed-source GPT models outperform open-source models in both internal consistency and alignment with human ratings, particularly excelling in language-related criteria. The o1 model outperforms all other LLMs, achieving Spearman's r =.74 with human assessments in the Overall score, and an internal consistency of ICC = .80, though biased towards higher scores. These findings indicate that LLM-based assessment can be a useful tool to reduce teacher workload by supporting the evaluation of essays, especially with regard to language-related criteria. However, due to their tendency to overrate and their remaining issues to capture the content quality, the models require further refinement.

AB  - Software testing education is important for building qualified testing professionals. To ensure that software testing graduates are ready for real-world challenges, it is necessary to integrate modern tools and technologies into the curriculum. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), their potential use in software engineering has become a focus, but their application in software testing education remains largely unexplored. This study, conducted in the Capstone Project course of a postgraduate software testing program, was carried out over two semesters with two distinct groups of students. A custom-built Travel Application limited to a web platform was used in the first semester. In the second semester, a new set of students worked with an open-source application, offering a larger-scale, multi-platform experience across web, desktop, and mobile platforms. Students initially created preparatory testing artifacts manually as a group deliverable. Following this, they were assigned an individual assignment to generate the same artifacts using LLM tools such as ChatGPT 3.5 in the first semester and Microsoft Copilot in the second. This process directly compared manually created artifacts and those generated using LLMs, leveraging AI for faster outputs. After completion, they responded to a set of assigned questions. The students' responses were assessed using an integrated methodology, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, sentiment analysis to understand emotions, and a thematic approach to extract deeper insights. The findings revealed that while LLMs can assist and augment manual testing efforts, they cannot entirely replace the need for manual testing. By incorporating innovative technology into the curriculum, this study highlights how Generative AI can support active learning, connect theoretical concepts with practical applications, and align educational practices with industry needs.

AB  - In the past years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown significant potential in augmenting human capabilities across various domains such as business and finance, creative arts and media, and education and training. This paper explores the development of a generative AI-based solution designed specifically to generate text for emotional intelligence (EI) interventions. Emotional intelligence, the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions, plays a critical role in personal and professional success. Despite the growing importance of EI, interventions aimed at enhancing these skills often face challenges due to the subjective nature of emotional experiences, and the complexity of human emotions and some of EI assessment tools. This paper proposes an innovative conceptual approach that proposes to leverage generative AI techniques to create personalized and contextually relevant text for EI training and development. The domain of interest is the education and training with a focus on students' EI skills, academic success, and future career development. The AI model can be trained on a diverse corpus of emotionally rich content, allowing it to generate nuanced and empathetic responses tailored to individual students' needs. Two approaches are considered. Fine-tuning existing models and prompt engineering using GPT-4 are considered. Application to generating prompts for the EI interventions is demonstrated. By integrating generative AI technologies, the proposed conceptual solution aims to enhance the effectiveness of EI interventions, making them more accessible, engaging, and impactful.

AB  - In current times, the incorporation of artificial intelligence that is AI in the world of education has demonstrated significant potential in reshaping conventional learning methods. Advanced language models, like ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, have emerged as valuable tools for enhancing educational interactions by introducing personalized and interactive learning environments. Within this context, the term "Intelligent Educational Chatbot for Student Interaction based on DaVinci Model" denotes the utilization of AI technology to innovate and create engaging learning experiences. The technology, exemplified by GPT-based models, has the capacity to potentially transform traditional educational approaches by delivering customized, contextually relevant, and captivating educational content. In conventional education systems, an average student lacks personalized learning experience. Also intelligent chatbot experiences like ChatGPT lack proper context and the information it provides does not have proper validation. This drawback can be overcome by adding context to the model trained so that it generates definitive answers. To implement such a model, we use the DaVinci model as a base model and fine tune it in such a way that the answers generated by it are context specific. So, with the implementation of the Intelligent Educational Chatbot for Student Interaction based on the DaVinci model, the lack of context the answers generated by the AI model can be rectified. Moreover, the answers generated by this model will be accurate and can be traced back to a proper source which properly validates the answers generated.

AB  - Researchers have been interested in developing AI tools to help students learn various mathematical subjects. One challenging set of tasks for school students is learning to solve math word problems. We explore how recent advances in natural language processing, specifically the rise of powerful transformer based models, can be applied to help math learners with such problems. Concretely, we evaluate the use of GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, all transformer models with billions of parameters recently released by OpenAI, for three related challenges pertaining to math word problems corresponding to systems of two linear equations. The three challenges are classifying word problems, extracting equations from word problems, and generating word problems. For the first challenge, we define a set of problem classes and find that GPT models generally result in classifying word problems with an overall accuracy around 70%. There is one class that all models struggle about, namely the "item and property"class, which significantly lowered the value. For the second challenge, our findings align with researchers' expectation: newer models are better at extracting equations from word problems. The highest accuracy we get from fine-tuning GPT-3 with 1000 examples (78%) is surpassed by GPT-4 given only 20 examples (79%). For the third challenge, we again find that GPT-4 outperforms the other two models. It is able to generate problems with accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 100%, depending on the problem type.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted clinical experience and exposure of medical students and junior doctors. Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration in medical education has the potential to enhance learning and improve patient care. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of three popular large language models (LLMs) in serving as clinical decision-making support tools for junior doctors.
   Methods: A series of increasingly complex clinical scenarios were presented to ChatGPT, Google's Bard and Bing's AI. Their responses were evaluated against standard guidelines, and for reliability by the Flesch Reading Ease Score, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the Coleman-Liau Index, and the modified DISCERN score for assessing suitability. Lastly, the LLMs outputs were assessed by using the Likert scale for accuracy, informativeness, and accessibility by three experienced specialists.
   Results: In terms of readability and reliability, ChatGPT stood out among the three LLMs, recording the highest scores in Flesch Reading Ease (31.2 +/- 3.5), Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (13.5 +/- 0.7), Coleman-Lau Index (13) and DISCERN (62 +/- 4.4). These results suggest statistically significant superior comprehensibility and alignment with clinical guidelines in the medical advice given by ChatGPT. Bard followed closely behind, with BingAI trailing in all categories. The only non-significant statistical differences (P > 0.05) were found between ChatGPT and Bard's readability indices, and between the Flesch Reading Ease scores of ChatGPT/Bard and BingAI.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential utility of LLMs in fostering self-directed and personalized learning, as well as bolstering clinical decision-making support for junior doctors. However further development is needed for its integration into education.

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging diagnostics has huge potential, but human judgement is still indispensable. We propose an AI-aided teaching method that leverages generative AI to train students on many images while preserving patient privacy.
   Methods A web-based course was designed using 600 synthetic ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal images to teach students to detect disease in these images. The images were generated by stable diffusion, a large generative foundation model, which we fine-tuned with 6285 real UWF images from six categories: five retinal diseases (age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment and retinal vein occlusion) and normal. 161 trainee orthoptists took the course. They were evaluated with two tests: one consisting of UWF images and another of standard field (SF) images, which the students had not encountered in the course. Both tests contained 120 real patient images, 20 per category. The students took both tests once before and after training, with a cool-off period in between.
   Results On average, students completed the course in 53 min, significantly improving their diagnostic accuracy. For UWF images, student accuracy increased from 43.6% to 74.1% (p<0.0001 by paired t-test), nearly matching the previously published state-of-the-art AI model's accuracy of 73.3%. For SF images, student accuracy rose from 42.7% to 68.7% (p<0.0001), surpassing the state-of-the-art AI model's 40%.
   Conclusion Synthetic images can be used effectively in medical education. We also found that humans are more robust to novel situations than AI models, thus showcasing human judgement's essential role in medical diagnosis.

AB  - detection and correction is an important activity that ensures the quality of written communication, especially in education, business, and legal documentation. Stateof-the-art NLP approaches have several issues, including overcorrection, poor handling of multilingual texts, and poor adaptability to domain-specific errors. Traditional methods, based on rule-based approaches or single-task models, fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications, especially in code-switched (multilingual) contexts and resource-scarce languages. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an advanced error detection and correction framework based on transformer- based models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). AThe hybrid approach integrates a Seq2Seq architecture with attention mechanisms and error-specific layers for handling grammatical and spelling errors. Synthetic data augmentation techniques, including back-translation, improve the system's robustness across diverse languages and domains. The architecture attains maximum accuracy of 99%, Asurpassing the state-of-the-art models, in this case, GPT-3 fine-tuned for grammatical error correction at 98%. It demonstrates superior performance in various multilingual and domain-specific settings, in addition to complex spelling challenges such as homophones and visually similar words. The system was realized using Python with TensorFlow and PyTorch. The system applies C4-200M for training and evaluation. The precision and recall rates, with realtime processing of text, render the model highly useful for practice applications in the areas of education, content development, and platforms for communication. This research fills a gap in present systems and hence contributes to an enhancement of automated improvement of writing skills in the English language, with a sound and scalable solution.

AB  - This research investigates the possible influence of students' perceptions of emerging AI technologies on university courses, focusing on their knowledge and perceived usefulness within engineering design. An evaluation tool implemented in a Microsoft Excel workbook was developed and tested to perform the process of data collection through well-known questionnaires, data analysis, and the generation of results, facilitating attention to class compositions and measuring AI awareness and perceived usefulness. The study considers traditional aspects such as roles within design teams and the psychological factors that may influence these roles, alongside contemporary topics like Large Language Models (LLMs). Questionnaires based on well-established theories were administered during courses on product innovation and representation, assessing both primary and secondary design roles. Primary roles focus on technical skills and knowledge, while secondary roles emphasize problem-solving approaches. The Big Five questionnaire was used to characterize students' psychological profiles based on the main personality traits. Students' perceptions of AI involvement and usefulness in engineering design were evaluated using questionnaires derived from the consolidated literature as well.

AB  - The recent challenge in higher education is to convey the importance of understanding concepts over rote learning. This challenge has increased in complexity with the arrival of large language model (LLM) based chatbots. Students are increasingly looking to such AI based chatbots as "sources of wisdom" instead of utilizing the same as learning aids. Despite disclaimers by the LLM creators, many students turn to the chatbot for answers to almost all learning assignments. This research work explores the level to which the LLM responses can be utilized for student learning in technical education. By understanding the contradictions between student answers and the responses generated by the LLMs, this work explores the limitations of the LLM based environments towards providing acceptable answers for assessments - specifically within the computer science engineering domain. While numerous studies have concentrated on ChatGPT, it is essential to consider the diverse range of alternative chat-bots accessible online that students may also utilize. Therefore, this work considers 5 popular AI-based chatbots for the study. With the "prompt" being the prime factor that impacts the response from chat-bots, the responses of the chatbots were collected using 2 different prompting techniques. The chatbot responses were evaluated against actual student responses by multiple reviewers to gauge its effectiveness as appropriate student answers. Both students and all chatbots were given questions aligned with the Blooms taxonomy levels (BTL) 1 to 4 in three different subjects. Each of the courses included a diverse range of questions including text-based questions, mathematical problems, and programming questions. The results show that the chatbot responses were acceptable for low BT level questions but failed to answer convincingly when asked for an algorithm. Overall, the chatbot performance (across the tested LLMs) was below average when the question set covered the BTL range 1-4. However, since the answers up to BTL2 were acceptable, LLM based chatbot answers were able to barely pass 1-2 of the 3 subjects (with the best performers scoring near the pass mark). Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that LLM based chatbots cannot be depended on for higher order learning but can be used to aid students who are struggling to pass basic courses.

AB  - In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into Learning Management Systems (LMS) has expanded, though many tools lack alignment with learning environment competencies, causing cognitive overload and diminishing learner motivation. This paper explores integrating an AI-based formative feedback system within an LMS, designed to enhance learner competencies and align with curriculum and learning objectives. Utilizing a self-trained large language model, the system processes predefined teaching materials to deliver efficient formative feedback, minimizing cognitive overload. Our study, involving 450 students from the University of Leipzig, assesses the impact of AI-generated feedback during lectures on learning performance, validated against specified learning objectives and competencies. Results emphasize the importance of incorporating sound pedagogical practices in developing AI tools for adaptive learning environments, demonstrating that AI-driven formative feedback can significantly enhance the efficacy of these environments and achieve educational goals.

AB  - Purpose of the study: Generative conversational artificial intelligence (AI) has huge potential to improve medical education. This pilot study evaluated the possibility of using a 'no-code' generative AI solution to create 2D and 3D virtual avatars, that trainee doctors can interact with to simulate patient encounters.Methods: The platform 'Convai' was used to create a virtual patient avatar, with a custom backstory, to test the feasibility of this technique. The virtual patient model was set up to allow trainee anaesthetists to practice answering questions that patients' may have about interscalene nerve blocks for open reduction and internal fixation surgery. This tool was provided to anaesthetists to receive their feedback and evaluate the feasibility of this approach.Results: Fifteen anaesthetists were surveyed after using the tool. The tool had a median score [interquartile range (IQR)] of 9 [7-10] in terms of how intuitive and user-friendly it was, and 8 [7-10] in terms of accuracy in simulating patient responses and behaviour. Eighty-seven percent of respondents felt comfortable using the model.Conclusions: By providing trainees with realistic scenarios, this technology allows trainees to practice answering patient questions regardless of actor availability, and indeed from home. Furthermore, the use of a 'no-code' platform allows clinicians to create customized training tools tailored to their medical specialties. While overall successful, this pilot study highlighted some of the current drawbacks and limitations of generative conversational AI, including the risk of outputting false information. Additional research and fine-tuning are required before generative conversational AI tools can act as a substitute for actors and peers.

AB  - Background: Health care practitioners use clinical decision support systems (CDSS) as an aid in the crucial task of clinical reasoning and decision-making. Traditional CDSS are online repositories (ORs) and clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Recently, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have emerged as potential alternatives. They have proven to be powerful, innovative tools, yet they are not devoid of worrisome risks. Objective: This study aims to explore how medical students perform in an evaluated clinical case through the use of different Methods: The authors randomly divided medical students into 3 groups, CPG, n=6 (38%); OR, n=5 (31%); and ChatGPT, n=5 (31%); and assigned each group a different type of CDSS for guidance in answering prespecified questions, assessing how students' speed and ability at resolving the same clinical case varied accordingly. External reviewers evaluated all answers based on accuracy and completeness metrics (score: 1-5). The authors analyzed and categorized group scores according to the skill investigated: differential diagnosis, diagnostic workup, and clinical decision-making. Results: Answering time showed a trend for the ChatGPT group to be the fastest. The mean scores for completeness were as follows: CPG 4.0, OR 3.7, and ChatGPT 3.8 (P=.49). The mean scores for accuracy were as follows: CPG 4.0, OR 3.3, and ChatGPT 3.7 (P=.02). Aggregating scores according to the 3 students' skill domains, trends in differences among the groups emerge more clearly, with the CPG group that performed best in nearly all domains and maintained almost perfect alignment Conclusions: This hands-on session provided valuable insights into the potential perks and associated pitfalls of LLMs in medical education and practice. It suggested the critical need to include teachings in medical degree courses on how to properly take advantage of LLMs, as the potential for misuse is evident and real.

AB  - Background: Knee osteoarthritis is a prevalent, chronic musculoskeletal disorder that impairs mobility and quality of life. Personalized patient education aims to improve self-management and adherence; yet, its delivery is often limited by time constraints, clinician workload, and the heterogeneity of patient needs. Recent advances in large language models offer potential solutions. GPT-4 (OpenAI), distinguished by its long-context reasoning and adoption in clinical artificial intelligence research, emerged as a leading candidate for personalized health communication. However, its application in generating condition-specific educational guidance remains underexplored, and concerns about misinformation, personalization limits, and ethical oversight remain. Objective: We evaluated GPT-4's ability to generate individualized self-management guidance for patients with knee osteoarthritis in comparison with clinician-created content. Methods: This 2-phase, double-blind, observational study used data from 50 patients previously enrolled in a registered randomized trial. In phase 1, 2 orthopedic clinicians each generated personalized education materials for 25 patient profiles using anonymized clinical data, including history, symptoms, and lifestyle. In phase 2, the same datasets were processed by GPT-4 using standardized prompts. All content was anonymized and evaluated by 2 independent, blinded clinical experts using validated scoring systems. Evaluation criteria included efficiency, readability (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook), accuracy, personalization, and comprehensiveness and safety. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through consensus or third-party adjudication. Results: GPT-4 outperformed clinicians in content generation speed (530.03 vs 37.29 words per min, P<.001). Readability was better on the Flesch-Kincaid (mean 11.56, SD 1.08 vs mean 12.67 SD 0.95), Gunning Fog (mean 12.47, SD 1.36 vs mean 14.56, SD 0.93), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (mean 13.33, SD 1.00 vs mean 13.81 SD 0.69) indices (all P<.001), though GPT-4 scored slightly higher on the Coleman-Liau Index (mean 15.90, SD 1.03 vs mean 15.15, SD 0.91). GPT-4 also outperformed clinicians in accuracy (mean 5.31, SD 1.73 vs mean 4.76, SD 1.10; P=.05, personalization (mean 54.32, SD 6.21 vs mean 33.20, SD 5.40; P<.001), comprehensiveness (mean 51.74, SD 6.47 vs mean 35.26, SD 6.66; P<.001), and safety (median 61, IQR 58-66 vs median 50, IQR 47-55.25; P<.001). Conclusions: GPT-4 could generate personalized self-management guidance for knee osteoarthritis with greater efficiency, accuracy, personalization, comprehensiveness, and safety than clinician-generated content, as assessed using standardized, guideline-aligned evaluation frameworks. These findings underscore the potential of large language models to support scalable, high-quality patient education in chronic disease management. The observed lexical complexity suggests the need to refine outputs for populations with limited health literacy. As an exploratory, single-center study, these results warrant confirmation in larger, multicenter cohorts with diverse demographic profiles. Future implementation should be guided by ethical and operational safeguards, including data privacy, transparency, and the delineation of clinical responsibility. Hybrid models integrating artificial intelligence-generated content with clinician oversight may offer a pragmatic path forward.

AB  - Background: Unhealthy food consumption in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) contributes to poor health outcomes among residents. This study aimed to assess its prevalence, identify demographic and physical risk factors, and propose targeted interventions. Methods: A mixed-methods study (2017-2021) analyzed data from 1000 Polish LTCF residents (aged 35-105 years). Anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance analyses, dietary assessments, and physical activity records were collected. Food items were classified as "healthy" or "unhealthy" using an AI-based Large Language Model (LLM), applying WHO guidelines and the NOVA classification system. Logistic regression and chi-square tests assessed associations between unhealthy food consumption and marital status, education level, mobility aid use, and portion control. Results: Unhealthy food consumption prevalence was 15.6%. Married residents had significantly higher rates than unmarried individuals (22.6% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.01). Lower educational attainment correlated with increased risk (partial primary education: 34.7% vs. tertiary education: 8.1%). Mobility aid users exhibited elevated consumption (cane: 34.6%; walker: 22.6%). Poor portion control showed the strongest association (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.8-5.7). Conclusions: Marital status, educational disparities, mobility limitations, and portion control were key modifiable risk factors. Findings suggest the need for targeted nutrition programs, caregiver education, and policy reforms to improve dietary literacy and meal portioning.

AB  - AimArtificial intelligence (AI) chatbots such as Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer-4 (ChatGPT-4) have made significant strides in generating human-like responses. Trained on an extensive corpus of medical literature, ChatGPT-4 has the potential to augment patient education materials. These chatbots may be beneficial to populations considering a diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the accuracy and quality of patient education materials are crucial for informed decision-making. Given workforce demands impacting holistic care, AI chatbots can bridge gaps in CRC information, reaching wider demographics and crossing language barriers. However, rigorous evaluation is essential to ensure accuracy, quality and readability. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy, quality and readability of answers generated by ChatGPT-4 on CRC, utilizing patient-style question prompts.MethodTo evaluate ChatGPT-4, eight CRC-related questions were derived using peer-reviewed literature and Google Trends. Eight colorectal surgeons evaluated AI responses for accuracy, safety, appropriateness, actionability and effectiveness. Quality was assessed using validated tools: the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT-AI), modified DISCERN (DISCERN-AI) and Global Quality Score (GQS). A number of readability assessments were measured including Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) and the Gunning Fog Index (GFI).ResultsThe responses were generally accurate (median 4.00), safe (4.25), appropriate (4.00), actionable (4.00) and effective (4.00). Quality assessments rated PEMAT-AI as 'very good' (71.43), DISCERN-AI as 'fair' (12.00) and GQS as 'high' (4.00). Readability scores indicated difficulty (FRE 47.00, GFI 12.40), suggesting a higher educational level was required.ConclusionThis study concludes that ChatGPT-4 is capable of providing safe but nonspecific medical information, suggesting its potential as a patient education aid. However, enhancements in readability through contextual prompting and fine-tuning techniques are required before considering implementation into clinical practice.

AB  - Reliance on social networks has become an integral part of modern daily activities. Social networks are crowded with vast numbers of comments, opinions, and beliefs about different aspects of people's daily lives. Opinions can directly express positive or negative perspectives toward a specific entity or its aspects, or they can be comparative opinions that present the differences or similarities between two or more entities, such as "product A is better than product B." Comparative opinions have significant potential to offer new opportunities across various fields such as marketing, education, and e-commerce. Thus, analyzing comparative opinions is essential. Indeed, comparative opinion mining has been applied in several languages, including Arabic. Nevertheless, comparative opinion mining in Arabic is still in its early stages and requires more contributions and investigations. Therefore, this work introduces the ACOM approach for Arabic Comparative Opinion Mining. First, we collected the ACOM corpus in Arabic from the X platform, focusing on comparative opinions in the technology domain. This paper provides a benchmark comparison of several deep-learning models by employing different approaches, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the deep learning model, the generated representation vector was used to construct the embedding layer as the first layer. To this end, we adopted two pretrained word embedding techniques to investigate their effectiveness on the ACOM corpus: Word2vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The main highlight of this paper is leveraging the most advanced innovation in AI, the GPT-3 model, as a classifier model. Our experimental results show that BERT and BiLSTM achieved impressive performance on the ACOM task with 91% accuracy and a 90% F1-score. Additionally, this paper discusses the impact of fine-tuning specific hyperparameters by providing a comprehensive examination.

KW  - chatgpt
AB  - Background ChatGPT is a language model that has gained widespread popularity for its fine-tuned conversational abilities. However, a known drawback to the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot is its tendency to confidently present users with inaccurate information. We evaluated the quality of ChatGPT responses to questions pertaining to atrial fibrillation for patient education. Our analysis included the accuracy and estimated grade level of answers and whether references were provided for the answers. Methodology ChatGPT was prompted four times and 16 frequently asked questions on atrial fibrillation from the American Heart Association were asked. Prompts included Form 1 (no prompt), Form 2 (patient-friendly prompt), Form 3 (physician-level prompt), and Form 4 (prompting for statistics/references). Responses were scored as incorrect, partially correct, or correct with references (perfect). Flesch-Kincaid grade-level unique words and response lengths were recorded for answers. Proportions of the responses at differing scores were compared using the chi-square analysis. The relationship between form and grade level was assessed using the analysis of variance. Results Across all forms, scoring frequencies were one (1.6%) incorrect, five (7.8%) partially correct, 55 (85.9%) correct, and three (4.7%) perfect. Proportions of responses that were at least correct did not differ by form (p = 0.350), but perfect responses did (p = 0.001). Form 2 answers had a lower mean grade level (12.80 +/- 3.38) than Forms 1 (14.23 +/- 2.34), 3 (16.73 +/- 2.65), and 4 (14.85 +/- 2.76) (p < 0.05). Across all forms, references were provided in only three (4.7%) answers. Notably, when additionally prompted for sources or references, ChatGPT still only provided sources on three responses out of 16 (18.8%). Conclusions ChatGPT holds significant potential for enhancing patient education through accurate, adaptive responses. Its ability to alter response complexity based on user input, combined with high accuracy rates, supports its use as an informational resource in healthcare settings. Future advancements and continuous monitoring of AI capabilities will be crucial in maximizing the benefits while mitigating the risks associated with AI-driven patient education.

AB  - As we witness groundbreaking advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is clear that the next generation must be equipped with AI literacy: the skill to interact, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems. This study introduces ActiveAI, a scalable web-based tutoring system aligned with AI4K12's five big ideas in AI, designed to foster AI literacy among K-12 students through active learning and interaction with intelligent agents. A controlled classroom study involving 171 middle school learners was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ActiveAI in fostering AI literacy skills and competency toward AI. Results showed that, compared to students in the tell-and-practice control condition, students who used ActiveAI exhibited higher post-test performance in the module about how next-word prediction and temperature work in large language models. Students also developed higher self-reported competence toward AI after using ActiveAI than in the control condition. We conclude by suggesting assessment designs that promote deeper engagement with AI concepts by addressing students' common misconceptions, like "AI thinks just like humans", in K-12 AI literacy education.

AB  - Background: Patients with rare and complex diseases often experience delayed diagnoses and misdiagnoses because comprehensive knowledge about these diseases is limited to only a few medical experts. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge aggregation tools with applications in clinical decision support and education domains. Objective: This study aims to explore the potential of 3 popular LLMs, namely Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI), and GPT-4 (OpenAI), in medical education to enhance the diagnosis of rare and complex diseases while investigating the impact of prompt engineering on their performance. Methods: We conducted experiments on publicly available complex and rare cases to achieve these objectives. We implemented various prompt strategies to evaluate the performance of these models using both open-ended and multiple-choice prompts. In addition, we used a majority voting strategy to leverage diverse reasoning paths within language models, aiming to enhance their reliability. Furthermore, we compared their performance with the performance of human respondents and MedAlpaca, a generative LLM specifically designed for medical tasks. Results: Notably, all LLMs outperformed the average human consensus and MedAlpaca, with a minimum margin of 5% and 13%, respectively, across all 30 cases from the diagnostic case challenge collection. On the frequently misdiagnosed cases category, Bard tied with MedAlpaca but surpassed the human average consensus by 14%, whereas GPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed MedAlpaca and the human respondents on the moderately often misdiagnosed cases category with minimum accuracy scores of 28% and 11%, respectively. The majority voting strategy, particularly with GPT-4, demonstrated the highest overall score across all cases from the diagnostic complex case collection, surpassing that of other LLMs. On the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care -III data sets, Bard and GPT-4 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy scores, with multiple-choice prompts scoring 93%, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 and MedAlpaca scored 73% and 47%, respectively. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that there is no one -size -fits -all prompting approach for improving the performance of LLMs and that a single strategy does not universally apply to all LLMs. Conclusions: Our findings shed light on the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs and the challenges associated with identifying an optimal prompting strategy that aligns with each language model's characteristics and specific task requirements. The significance of prompt engineering is highlighted, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners who use these language models for medical training. Furthermore, this study represents a crucial step toward understanding how LLMs can enhance diagnostic reasoning in rare and complex medical cases, paving the way for developing effective educational tools and accurate diagnostic aids to improve patient care and outcomes.

AB  - Purpose While it is common practice for schools across the United States to include neurodivergent children in physical education classes, many programs outside of school-such as those at home or in the community-are not effectively tailored to meet their support needs. This gap contributes to lower levels of physical activity among neurodivergent children. Our objective was to address this issue by systematically adapting the InPACT (Interrupting Prolonged sitting with ACTivity) at Home program to enable neurodivergent children to safely engage in physical activity at home.Methods The rapid-cycle research adaptation process involved several key steps: (1) sorting and grouping video content based on different types of skills and exercises (problem exploration); (2) assembling an expert team to guide the development of the instructions (knowledge exploration); and (3) using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create concise instructions and cue words for each skill/exercise (solution development). These outputs were then fine-tuned by the expert team. The refinements were guided by the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principle of "Representation," which acknowledges that learners perceive and understand information in diverse ways.Results From the 132 InPACT at Home videos, over 500 activities were identified and categorized into main skill groups: jumping, core, lateral, sport, upper body, lower body, and compound movements. Expert meetings emphasized the importance of the "Three C's"-consistency, conciseness, and clarity-in crafting instructions, along with the use of simple, elementary sight words. AI was employed to generate and refine prompts like "Provide simplified step-by-step instructions for a jumping jack, suitable for a neurodivergent child" and "Condense the step-by-step instructions for a jumping jack, suitable for a neurodivergent child".Discussion The adaptation of the existing InPACT at Home program was guided by dissemination and implementation science frameworks, aiming to increase equitable access to structured youth physical activity opportunities for neurodivergent children. By incorporating AI and UDL principles, we aim to further enhance the program's accessibility. Our next steps include evaluating the effectiveness of our program adaptations in encouraging participation in the InPACT at Home program and subsequently increasing physical activity levels among neurodivergent children.

AB  - PurposeThis research aims to investigate the use of conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) in academic practice through the lens of activity theory, which emphasises the mediation of human actions by tools within a social context. Additionally, it seeks to determine if and how the results of qualitative analysis differ when using traditional qualitative analysis software tools compared to using artificial intelligence tools.Design/methodology/approachA pragmatic approach to the research design was used. The data collection phase included a survey, with open- and closed-ended questions and was distributed to academics in four countries (South Africa, Hungary, Lebanon and Wales). The data analysis phase included a mixed-methods approach integrating and interpreting both types of data to leverage the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative insights. Furthermore, traditional qualitative analysis methods and artificial intelligence tools were used for the analysis phase, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between academics and these tools.FindingsYounger academics used CAI more for research than teaching, with academics from the science faculty using it more for teaching, and business management lecturers using it more for research. While viewed positively, concerns arose about ethics and educational alignment. This research shows how CAI supports qualitative analysis by saving time and suggesting new directions.Originality/valueUsing an "activity theory" theoretical lens, with a pragmatic approach, the research explores how CAI tools impact academic practices. The study enriches theoretical discourse and offers practical recommendations for education.

TI  - AI and ethics: Investigating the first policy responses of higher education institutions to the challenge of generative AI
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
LA  - English
AB  - This article addresses the ethical challenges posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in higher education and explores the first responses of universities to these challenges globally. Drawing on five key international documents from the UN, EU, and OECD, the study used content analysis to identify key ethical dimensions related to the use of generative AI in academia, such as accountability, human oversight, transparency, or inclusiveness. Empirical evidence was compiled from 30 leading universities ranked among the top 500 in the Shanghai Ranking list from May to July 2023, covering those institutions that already had publicly available responses to these dimensions in the form of policy documents or guidelines. The paper identifies the central ethical imperative that student assignments must reflect individual knowledge acquired during their education, with human individuals retaining moral and legal responsibility for AI-related wrongdoings. This top-down requirement aligns with a bottom-up approach, allowing instructors flexibility in determining how they utilize generative AI especially large language models in their own courses. Regarding human oversight, the typical response identified by the study involves a blend of preventive measures (e.g., course assessment modifications) and soft, dialogue-based sanctioning procedures. The challenge of transparency induced the good practice of clear communication of AI use in course syllabi in the first university responses examined by this study.

AB  - The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in education has introduced innovative approaches to assessment. One such approach is AI chatbot-based assessment, which utilizes large language models to provide students with timely and consistent feedback. However, the effectiveness of AI chatbots in generating assessments comparable to human evaluators in educational contexts remains underexplored. This study compared the grades and feedback provided by AI chatbots, peers, and the course instructor for student projects in a higher education course. The participants were 76 undergraduate students who engaged in a group project involving three phases: questionnaire development, peer assessment, and chatbot-based assessment. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this study quantitatively compared project grades and qualitatively analyzed feedback quality. Results indicated that AI chatbots consistently assigned higher grades than human assessors, while peer and instructor grades were notably lower and closely aligned. Content analysis revealed that chatbots generally provided higher-quality feedback compared to peers, offering detailed insights and specific guidance for improvement, though they occasionally included irrelevant or contradictory information requiring student intervention. Conversely, peer feedback was more personalized and context-sensitive. These findings highlight the importance of human judgment, suggesting that integrating chatbot-based assessments with traditional methods can leverage their complementary strengths to enrich student learning.

AB  - StandUp Reports play an important role in capstone software engineering courses, facilitating progress tracking, obstacle identification, and team collaboration. However, despite their significance, students often grapple with the challenge of creating StandUp Reports that are clear, concise, and actionable. This paper investigates the impact of the use of generative AI in producing StandUp report recommendations, aiming to assist students in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of their reports. In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each submitted report, students voluntarily answered a survey about usability and suggestion preference. Furthermore, we conducted a linguistic analysis of the recommendations made by the algorithms to gauge reading ease and comprehension complexity. Our findings indicate that the AI-based recommendation system helped students improve the overall quality of their StandUp Reports throughout the semester. Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with the tool and exhibited a strong willingness to continue using it in the future. The survey reveals that students perceived a slight improvement when using GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. Finally, a computational linguistic analysis performed on the recommendations demonstrates that both algorithms significantly improve the alignment between the generated texts and the students' educational level, thereby improving the quality of the original texts.

AB  - Providing effective feedback in large settings presents significant challenges due to time and resource constraints. Given the importance of feedback in competency-based higher education, innovative solutions are essential. This study explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance feedback delivery. The research focuses on the development of a custom prompt for GPT-4 within a no-code web application, designed to deliver AI-generated feedback to second-year accounting students on discussion or essay-style questions in a large competency-based intermediate accounting course in South Africa. The prompt aligns with the principles of effective feedback and was tested in a pilot evaluation. Results indicated that the AI-generated feedback generally adhered to these principles, though some variability was observed across the different feedback dimensions. While challenges remain in consistently guiding AI to apply pedagogical best practices, the findings suggest that large language models can complement traditional feedback. Rigorous oversight of AI-generated feedback remains critical.

AB  - This study explores the potential role of AI-generated mentoring within simulated environments designed for teacher education, specifically focused on the challenges of teaching controversial issues. Using a mixed-methods approach, we empirically investigate the potential and challenges of AI-generated feedback compared to that provided by human experts when mentoring preservice teachers in the context of mixed reality simulations. Findings reveal that human experts offered more mixed and nuanced feedback than ChatGPT-4o and Perplexity, especially when identifying missed teaching opportunities and balancing classroom discussions. The AI models evaluated were publicly available pro versions of LLMs and were tested using detailed prompts and coding schemes aligned with educational theories. AI systems were not very good at identifying aspects of general, pedagogical or content knowledge based on Shulman's theories but were still quite effective in generating feedback in line with human experts. The study highlights the promise of AI to enhance teacher training but underscores the importance of combining AI feedback with expert insights to address the complexities of real-world teaching. This research contributes to a growing understanding of AI's potential role and limitations in education. It suggests that, while AI can be valuable to scale mixed reality simulations, it should be carefully evaluated and balanced by human expertise in teacher education.

AB  - Investigation of students' perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking.
   In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly.
   We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall '23, winter '23, and spring '24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time.
   We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.

AB  - Large language models built upon artificial intelligence (AI) hold great promises to innovate automatic short answer scoring (ASAS)- significantly alleviating educators' workload in assessing student answers. However, ASAS systems on such basis have seen limited adoption in authentic teaching environments due to the models' inability to explain the predictions they generate. To address this, we recruited 32 human graders to comparatively analyse the decision-making processes of human graders and AI-driven graders. Specifically, we exploited two types of data to holistically unveil the decision-making processes of human graders throughout grading, namely manual annotation of important words and gaze data of the human graders. The decision-making processes of AI-driven graders were revealed by important words extracted though eXplainable Artificial Intelligence technique and grading confidence reflected by the prediction probability distributions. We measured the alignment in their decision-making regarding their (i) estimated scoring difficulty, (ii) important text segments and (iii) crucial grammatical categories to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of AI-driven graders. Subsequently, we conducted randomised control studies, presenting machine-extracted insights like important words and estimated scoring difficulty to scrutinise how they affected human grading. Our findings contribute new knowledge regarding the consistency between human and machine scoring and validates machine-extracted insights, such as important words and scoring difficulty, to be valuable in facilitating human grading, encouraging the adoption of ASAS systems and urging the potential collaboration between machine and human grading in pedagogical practices. However, we emphasised the significance of grasping question context and intricacy before leveraging such machine-extracted insights.

AB  - The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential in the field of education. The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT's output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer. The intention of the paper is to act as a catalyst for a broader conversation about the use of generative AI in science education.

AB  - Personalized e-learning systems have transformed the delivery of educational content, aligning it more closely with individual learners' needs. Among the various approaches to achieving this personalization, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality prediction emerged as a valuable tool for adapting learning content to match individual preferences and learning styles. Despite these advancements, personalized e-learning systems quite struggle with handling large volumes of information, often facing difficulties in balancing prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. To ensure personalization, integrating advanced technologies such as machine learning and deep learning is crucial for creating more sustainable and effective learning environments. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates MBTI personality prediction with a deep learning approach and a Learner Profile ontology (LPO) to enhance the personalization and recommendation process. The proposed method employs the BERT model, a Transformer-based architecture, for personality prediction, combined with an oversampling technique to handle data imbalance. The predicted personality type is incorporated into a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)-based ontology enriched with WordNet, enabling better alignment of learning resources with individual learner traits. Experimental results validate the efficacy of this integrated approach, demonstrating significant improvements in learner satisfaction and educational outcomes.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds promise as a tool to assist teachers in addressing specific instructional design and implementation tasks. This study explores how teachers in a master's-level elementary science methods course used Large Language Model AI, as one type of GenAI, to design lessons fostering students' environmental science agency (ESA). The course introduced ESA as one of pedagogical constructs that emphasize the importance of science learning relevant and consequential to students' lives, and encouraged teachers to use GenAI for their ESA-focused lesson design projects. Data sources included surveys, lesson design documents, GenAI chat logs, and field notes. Findings, derived through constant comparative analysis, highlight GenAI's utility in three areas: (1) deepening teachers' conceptual understanding; (2) developing detailed content of lesson components; and (3) integrating ESA into science instruction. Teachers also reported the challenges they encountered and addressed mainly in two ways: (1) ensuring the quality of GenAI-generated responses and (2) aligning these responses with their specific lesson visions. These findings were discussed in terms of teacher perspectives on ESA integration and their effort to take authorship and responsibility in their project process and outcomes. The study concludes by calling for follow-up teacher education practice and research focused on creating science learning opportunities, including those with proper and ethical use of GenAI, that go beyond knowledge enhancement to fostering civic participation aimed at justice-oriented and transformative changes, as envisioned by the concept and practices of ESA.

AB  - In this paper, we initially investigate the capabilities of GPT-3 5 and GPT-4 in solving college-level calculus problems, an essential segment of mathematics that remains under-explored so far. Although improving upon earlier versions, GPT-4 attains approximately 65% accuracy for standard problems and decreases to 20% for competition-like scenarios. Overall, the models prove to be unreliable due to common arithmetic errors.Our primary contribution lies then in examining the use of ChatGPT for grading solutions to calculus exercises. Our objectives are to probe an in-context learning task with less emphasis over direct calculations; recognize positive applications of ChatGPT in educational contexts; highlight a potentially emerging facet of AI that could necessitate oversight; and introduce unconventional AI benchmarks, for which models like GPT are untrained. Pertaining to the latter, we uncover a tendency for loss of coherence in extended contexts. Our findings suggest that while the current ChatGPT exhibits comprehension of the grading task and often provides relevant outputs, the consistency of grading is marred by occasional loss of coherence and hallucinations. Intriguingly, GPT-4's overall scores, delivered in mere moments, align closely with human graders, although its detailed accuracy remains suboptimal.This work suggests that, when appropriately orchestrated, collaboration between human graders and LLMs like GPT-4 might combine their unique strengths while mitigating their respective shortcomings In this direction, it is imperative to consider implementing transparency, fairness, and appropriate regulations in the near future.

AB  - BackgroundAsthma is a complex and heterogeneous chronic disease affecting over 300 million individuals worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacotherapy, poor disease control remains a major challenge, necessitating innovative approaches to patient education and self-management. Artificial intelligence driven chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, have the potential to enhance asthma care by providing real-time, evidence-based information. As asthma management moves toward personalized medicine, AI could support individualized education and treatment guidance. However, concerns remain regarding the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated medical content.ObjectiveThis study evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT (version 4.0) and Gemini (version 1.2) in providing asthma-related health information using the Patient-completed Asthma Knowledge Questionnaire, a validated asthma literacy tool.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in which both AI models answered 54 standardized asthma-related items. Responses were classified as correct or incorrect based on alignment with validated clinical knowledge. Accuracy was assessed using descriptive statistics, Cohen's kappa for inter-model agreement, and chi-square tests for comparative performance.ResultsChatGPT achieved an accuracy of 96.3% (52/54 correct; 95% CI: 87.5%-99.0%), while Gemini scored 92.6% (50/54 correct; 95% CI: 82.5%-97.1%), with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.67). Cohen's kappa demonstrated near-perfect agreement for ChatGPT (kappa = 0.91) and strong agreement for Gemini (kappa = 0.82).ConclusionChatGPT and Gemini demonstrated high accuracy in delivering asthma-related health information, supporting their potential as adjunct tools for patient education. AI models could potentially play a role in personalized asthma management by providing tailored treatment guidance and improving patient engagement.

AB  - New developments in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field allowed the development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), capable of creating text resembling what humans can produce. As a result, educators' concerns in the higher education sector quickly emerged. Many organizations and experts have addressed these concerns through recommendations. In this conceptual paper, we draw from the Integrated Model for Academic Integrity through a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Lens to examine and stimulate discussion from twelve documents that focus on using GenAI with integrity. We identified recommendations suitable for the individual (micro), the departmental/program (meso), the institutional (macro), and the interinstitutional/ national/ international (mega) levels concerning two core elements of the model: "high-impact professional learning for individuals and groups" and "local-level leadership and microcultures." Suggestions around the core element "scholarship, research and inquiry" were lacking at the micro and meso levels; likewise, recommendations for the core element "learning spaces, pedagogies, and technologies" were also absent at the meso, macro, and mega levels. We acknowledge that these recommendations focus on learning, involve various stakeholders, and go beyond student conduct, which aligns with current approaches to academic integrity. However, some gaps need further exploration. We highlight the need to develop more specific and practical guidance and resources for educational stakeholders around GenAI issues related to academic integrity, explore how to better support networks and leaders in higher education in creating the conditions for ethical GenAI use, and emphasizing the need for an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion lens on GenAI.

AB  - Entrepreneurship education has evolved to meet the demands of a dynamic business environment, necessitating innovative teaching methods to prepare entrepreneurs for market uncertainties. Large Language Models (LLMs) like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), recognized for their exceptional performance on public datasets, are examined in this study for their potential adaptability and interactivity nature, which align well with the dynamic nature of entrepreneurship learning. The interaction with LLMs can be enhanced by using effective prompt engineering techniques (PETs) that allow for crafting precise queries to elicit accurate and relevant responses for entrepreneurial learning. Critical concerns regarding the use of GPT-4 and conversational agents in entrepreneurship courses include the reliability and accuracy of data sources, the necessity for specific, real-time data for effective decision-making, and the lack of in-depth exploration of effective prompting strategies tailored to entrepreneurship education. Addressing these issues, this study aims to identify and compare the quality output of currently available PETs, develop innovative PETs that are well-aligned with entrepreneurial learning, and provide guidelines on how to fully utilize LLMs and conversational agents with Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) technology in entrepreneurship education. The combination of conversational agents and RAG technology into a hybrid innovative approach overcomes inherent limitations in each technology separately and enhances efficiency and relevancy in entrepreneurship education through exact, dynamic interactions and advanced memory capabilities. The findings of the study significantly contribute to the field of entrepreneurship by offering practical insights for students and educators on enhancing the entrepreneurship learning experience, particularly by utilizing cutting-edge technology to improve data relevance and answer accuracy in entrepreneurial queries and scenarios.

AB  - The biology education literature includes compelling assertions that unfamiliar problems are especially useful for revealing students' true understanding of biology. However, there is only limited evidence that such novel problems have different cognitive requirements than more familiar problems. Here, we sought additional evidence by using chatbots based on large language models as models of biology students. For human physiology and cell biology, we developed sets of realistic and hypothetical problems matched to the same lesson learning objectives (LLOs). Problems were considered hypothetical if (i) known biological entities (molecules and organs) were given atypical or counterfactual properties (redefinition) or (ii) fictitious biological entities were introduced (invention). Several chatbots scored significantly worse on hypothetical problems than on realistic problems, with scores declining by an average of 13%. Among hypothetical questions, redefinition questions appeared especially difficult, with many chatbots scoring as if guessing randomly. These results suggest that, for a given LLO, hypothetical problems may have different cognitive demands than realistic problems and may more accurately reveal students' ability to apply biology core concepts to diverse contexts. The Test Question Templates (TQT) framework, which explicitly connects LLOs with examples of assessment questions, can help educators generate problems that are challenging (due to their novelty), yet fair (due to their alignment with pre-specified LLOs). Finally, ChatGPT's rapid improvement toward expert-level answers suggests that future educators cannot reasonably expect to ignore or outwit chatbots but must do what we can to make assessments fair and equitable.

AB  - Large language models are reshaping computing education. Based on recent research, these models explain code better than students, answer multiple choice questions at or above the class average, and generate code that can pass automated tests in introductory courses. In response to these capabilities, instructors have quickly adjusted their courses and assessment methods to align with shifting learning goals and the increased risk of academic integrity issues. While some scholars have advocated for the integration of visual problems as a safeguard against the capabilities of language models, new multimodal models now have vision and language capabilities that may allow them to analyze and solve visual problems. In this paper, we compare the large multimodal model (LMMs) GPT-4V with Bard, an LLM that uses Google Lens for text recognition. We find that LMMs, which have learned both pixel features (from images) and text features (from prompts) in the same embedding space, performed substantially better than Bard which uses a piecemeal approach. With a specific focus on Parsons problems presented across diverse visual representations, our results show that GPT-4V solved 96.7% these visual problems, struggling minimally with a single Parsons problem. Conversely, Bard performed poorly by only solving 69.2% of problems, struggling with common issues like hallucinations and refusals. These findings suggest that merely transitioning to visual programming problems might not be a panacea to issues of academic integrity in the generative AI era.

AB  - The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has paved the way for innovative assessment methods. This study explores the capabilities of GPT-4, which is a large language model (LLM), on a medicine exam and for formative and summative assessments in Norwegian educational settings. This research builds on our previous work to explore how AI, specifically GPT-4, can enhance assessment practices by evaluating its performance on a full-scale medical multiple-choice exam. Prior studies have revealed that LLM's can have certain potential in medical education but have not specifically examined how GPT-4 can enhance formative and summative assessments in medical education. Therefore, my study contributes to filling gaps in the current knowledge by examining GPT-4's capabilities for formative and summative assessment in medical education in Norway. For this purpose, a case study design was employed, and the primary data sources were 110 exam questions, 10 blinded exam questions, and 2 patient cases within medicine. The findings from this intrinsic case study revealed that GPT-4 performed well on the summative assessment, with a robust handling of the Norwegian medical language. Further, GPT-4 demonstrated a reliable evaluation of comprehensive student exams, such as patient cases, and, thus, aligned closely with human assessments. The findings suggest that GPT-4 can improve formative assessment by providing timely, personalized feedback to support student learning. This study highlights the importance of both an empirical and theoretical understanding of the gap between traditional assessment methods and educational practices and AI-enhanced approaches-particularly the importance of the ability of chain-of-thought prompting, how AI can scaffold tutoring, and assessment practices. However, continuous refinement and human oversight remain crucial to ensure the effective and responsible integration of LLM's like GPT-4 into educational settings.

AB  - Background: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT have revolutionised patient education by offering accessible, reasonable, and empathetic guidance. This study evaluates ChatGPT's role in supporting patient inquiries regarding four key plastic surgery procedures: mastopexy, breast augmentation, breast reduction, and breast reconstruction. The study highlights its potential as a supplemental tool in patient education by assessing its performance across relevance, accuracy, clarity, and empathy criteria. Methods: The study collected frequently asked questions from patients about the selected procedures during pre-and post-operative consultations. Responses were generated by ChatGPT and evaluated by a panel of Plastic Surgery experts. Scores from 1 to 5 were assigned to four criteria: relevance, accuracy, clarity, and empathy. Statistical analyses, including means, standard deviations, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, were conducted to evaluate differences in the scores assigned to responses across criteria and procedures. Results: ChatGPT demonstrated high performance across all evaluation criteria, with clarity emerging as the strongest attribute, reflecting the model's ability to simplify complex medical concepts effectively. Accuracy, while slightly lower, remained reliable, aligning well with medical standards. Among the procedures, breast reconstruction appeared to perform particularly well, followed closely by mastopexy and breast augmentation. The analysis revealed no significant differences across the criteria, indicating consistent performance. Conclusions: ChatGPT demonstrated remarkable capability in addressing patient concerns and offering clear, empathetic, and relevant responses. However, limitations include the lack of personalised advice and potential patient misinterpretations, emphasising the need for professional oversight. ChatGPT is a valuable adjunct to professional medical consultations, enhancing patient education and engagement. Future research should focus on improving personalisation and evaluating its real-world application in clinical settings.

AB  - ChatGPT, an AI capable of processing and generating human-like language, has been studied in medical education and care, yet its potential in histopathological diagnosis remains unexplored. This study evaluates ChatGPT's reliability in addressing pathology-related diagnostic questions across ten subspecialties and its ability to provide scientific references. We crafted five clinico-pathological scenarios per subspecialty, simulating a pathologist using ChatGPT to refine differential diagnoses. Each scenario, aligned with current diagnostic guidelines and validated by expert pathologists, was posed as open-ended or multiple-choice questions, either requesting scientific references or not. Outputs were assessed by six pathologists according to. (1) usefulness in supporting the diagnosis and (2) absolute number of errors. We used directed acyclic graphs and structural causal models to determine the effect of each scenario type, field, question modality, and pathologist evaluation. We yielded 894 evaluations. ChatGPT provided useful answers in 62.2% of cases, and 32.1% of outputs contained no errors, while the remaining had at least one error. ChatGPT provided 214 bibliographic references: 70.1% correct, 12.1% inaccurate, and 17.8% non-existing. Scenario variability had the greatest impact on ratings, and latent knowledge across fields showed minimal variation. Although ChatGPT provided useful responses in one-third of cases, the frequency of errors and variability underscores its inadequacy for routine diagnostic use and highlights the need for discretion as a support tool. Imprecise referencing also suggests caution as a self-learning tool. It is essential to recognize the irreplaceable role of human experts in synthesizing images, clinical data, and experience for the intricate task of histopathological diagnosis.

AB  - Digital teachers represent an innovative fusion of media and artificial intelligence (AI) within online educational environments. However, the specific ways in which the appearance anthropomorphism of digital teachers influences the delivery of different knowledge types remain insufficiently understood. Drawing on Embodied Learning Theory and Parasocial Interaction Theory, this study investigates how digital teachers' appearance (cartoonish versus realistic) interacts with knowledge types (explicit versus tacit) to affect digital learning satisfaction and usage intention, exploring the mediating roles of physical and social presence. Initially, we implemented a 2 x 2 experimental design using a large language model application, collecting data from 475 participants to empirically test our hypotheses. Subsequently, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 Chinese university students to further validate and clarify the underlying mechanisms behind these interactions. The results indicate that digital teachers with a cartoonish appearance are more effective for delivering explicit knowledge, whereas digital teachers with a realistic appearance excel in conveying tacit knowledge. Both physical presence and social presence were found to significantly mediate these effects. This research enriches our understanding of AI-enhanced online education by highlighting the alignment effect between digital teacher appearance and the type of knowledge delivered and by uncovering the underlying psychological mechanisms. In addition, it offers practical insights for the design of digital human appearances in educational interfaces and broader AI-human interaction scenarios.

AB  - This paper explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) into the teaching-learning-assessment processes within Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), particularly those located in developing countries. Through a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both qualitative insights from ChatGPT 4.0-generated 'Personas' representing international experts and quantitative analysis, this study evaluates the potential risks and delineates strategic pathways for the responsible implementation of Gen AI under limited financial and technological resources. The 'Personas' provided evaluations on a Likert scale, assessing risks, required actions, and resources necessary for Gen AI integration, which were then analyzed through descriptive statistics and visualized for interpretation. The findings highlight the most significant challenges as legal and ethical issues, technological dependence, and student development, echoing concerns noted in existing literature. To mitigate these risks, the study suggests a series of sequential strategies including promoting balanced technology use, investing in mental health initiatives, developing skills for educators, supporting AI literacy, creating culturally responsive AI content, and developing inclusive technology policies. Moreover, creating AI tools to enhance teaching and investing in equitable technological infrastructure are identified as resource-intensive actions, with a special emphasis on the prioritization of human resource investment as a starting point for HEIs with financial constraints. It is crucial to note the limitations of this work, given that the expert 'Personas' are hound by the training data and capabilities of the Large Language Model used. Therefore, the careful evaluation of the advice provided to ensure alignment with each institution's mission and philosophy is mandatory. Despite these limitations, the study offers valuable insights and a call-to-action for HEIs to lead the charge in integrating Gen AI across society.

AB  - PURPOSEAlthough large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical practice, formal assessments of their quality, accuracy, and effectiveness in medical oncology remain limited. We aimed to evaluate the ability of ChatGPT, an LLM, to generate physician and patient letters from clinical case notes.METHODSSix oncologists created 29 (four training, 25 final) synthetic oncology case notes. Structured prompts for ChatGPT were iteratively developed using the four training cases; once finalized, 25 physician-directed and patient-directed letters were generated. These underwent evaluation by expert consumers and oncologists for accuracy, relevance, and readability using Likert scales. The patient letters were also assessed with the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT-P), Flesch Reading Ease, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook index.RESULTSAmong physician-to-physician letters, 95% (119/125) of oncologists agreed they were accurate, comprehensive, and relevant, with no safety concerns noted. These letters demonstrated precise documentation of history, investigations, and treatment plans and were logically and concisely structured. Patient-directed letters achieved a mean Flesch Reading Ease score of 73.3 (seventh-grade reading level) and a PEMAT-P score above 80%, indicating high understandability. Consumer reviewers found them clear and appropriate for patient communication. Some omissions of details (eg, side effects), stylistic inconsistencies, and repetitive phrasing were identified, although no clinical safety issues emerged. Seventy-two percent (90/125) of consumers expressed willingness to receive artificial intelligence (AI)-generated patient letters.CONCLUSIONChatGPT, when guided by structured prompts, can generate high-quality letters that align with clinical and patient communication standards. No clinical safety concerns were identified, although addressing occasional omissions and improving natural language flow could enhance their utility in practice. Further studies comparing AI-generated and human-written letters are recommended.

AB  - -INTRODUCTION: Technological advancements are reshaping medical education, with digital tools becoming essential in all levels of training. Amidst this trans-formation, the study explores the potential of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence model by OpenAI, in enhancing neurosurgical board education. The focus extends beyond technology adoption to its effective utilization, with ChatGPT's proficiency evaluated against practice ques-tions from the Primary Neurosurgery Written Board Exam. -METHODS: Using the Congress of Neurologic Surgeons (CNS) Self-Assessment Neurosurgery (SANS) Exam Board Review Prep questions, we conducted 3 rounds of analysis with ChatGPT. We developed a novel ChatGPT Neurosur-gical Evaluation Matrix (CNEM) to assess the output quality, accuracy, concordance, and clarity of ChatGPT's answers.-RESULTS: ChatGPT achieved spot-on accuracy for 66.7% of prompted questions, 59.4% of unprompted questions, and 63.9% of unprompted questions with a leading phrase. Stratified by topic, accuracy ranged from 50.0% (Vascular) to 78.8% (Neuropathology). In comparison to SANS expla-nations, ChatGPT output was considered better in 19.1% of questions, equal in 51.6%, and worse in 29.3%. Concor-dance analysis showed that 95.5% of unprompted ChatGPT outputs and 97.4% of unprompted outputs with a leading phrase were aligned.-CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in neurosurgical board education by assessing its accuracy, clarity, and concordance. The findings highlight the potential and challenges of integrating AI technologies like ChatGPT into medical and neurosurgical board edu-cation. Further research is needed to refine these tools and optimize their performance for enhanced medical educa-tion and patient care.

KW  - Medical education
KW  - Cognitive processes
AB  - Background The creation of high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) is essential for medical education assessments but is resource-intensive and time-consuming when done by human experts. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4o offer a promising alternative, but their efficacy remains unclear, particularly in high-stakes exams. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the quality and psychometric properties of ChatGPT-4o-generated MCQs compared to human-created MCQs in a high-stakes medical licensing exam. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted among medical doctors preparing for the Primary Examination on Emergency Medicine (PEEM) organised by the Hong Kong College of Emergency Medicine in August 2024. Participants attempted two sets of 100 MCQs-one AI-generated and one human-generated. Expert reviewers assessed MCQs for factual correctness, relevance, difficulty, alignment with Bloom's taxonomy (remember, understand, apply and analyse), and item writing flaws. Psychometric analyses were performed, including difficulty and discrimination indices and KR-20 reliability. Candidate performance and time efficiency were also evaluated. Results Among 24 participants, AI-generated MCQs were easier (mean difficulty index = 0.78 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.23, p < 0.01) but showed similar discrimination indices to human MCQs (mean = 0.22 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.26 +/- 0.26). Agreement was moderate (ICC = 0.62, p = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.12-0.84). Expert reviews identified more factual inaccuracies (6% vs. 4%), irrelevance (6% vs. 0%), and inappropriate difficulty levels (14% vs. 1%) in AI MCQs. AI questions primarily tested lower-order cognitive skills, while human MCQs better assessed higher-order skills (chi(2) = 14.27, p = 0.003). AI significantly reduced time spent on question generation (24.5 vs. 96 person-hours). Conclusion ChatGPT-4o demonstrates the potential for efficiently generating MCQs but lacks the depth needed for complex assessments. Human review remains essential to ensure quality. Combining AI efficiency with expert oversight could optimise question creation for high-stakes exams, offering a scalable model for medical education that balances time efficiency and content quality.

AB  - Background: Standardized patients (SPs) have been crucial in medical education, offering realistic patient interactions to students. Despite their benefits, SP training is resource-intensive and access can be limited. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models such as ChatGPT, present new opportunities for virtual SPs, potentially addressing these limitations. Objectives: This study aims to assess medical students' perceptions and experiences of using ChatGPT as an SP and to evaluate ChatGPT's effectiveness in performing as a virtual SP in a medical school setting. Methods: This qualitative study, approved by the American University of Antigua Institutional Review Board, involved 9 students (5 females and 4 males, aged 22-48 years) from the American University of Antigua College of Medicine. Students were observed during a live role-play, interacting with ChatGPT as an SP using a predetermined prompt. A structured 15-question survey was administered before and after the interaction. Thematic analysis was conducted on the transcribed and coded responses, with inductive category formation. Results: Thematic analysis identified key themes preinteraction including technology limitations (eg, prompt engineering difficulties), learning efficacy (eg, potential for personalized learning and reduced interview stress), verisimilitude (eg, absence of visual cues), and trust (eg, concerns about AI accuracy). Postinteraction, students noted improvements in prompt engineering, some alignment issues (eg, limited responses on sensitive topics), maintained learning efficacy (eg, convenience and repetition), and continued verisimilitude challenges (eg, lack of empathy and nonverbal cues). No significant trust issues were reported postinteraction. Despite some limitations, students found ChatGPT as a valuable supplement to traditional SPs, enhancing practice flexibility and diagnostic skills. Conclusions: ChatGPT can effectively augment traditional SPs in medical education, offering accessible, flexible practice opportunities. However, it cannot fully replace human SPs due to limitations in verisimilitude and prompt engineering challenges. Integrating prompt engineering into medical curricula and continuous advancements in AI are recommended to enhance the use of virtual SPs.

AB  - Background: High-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are essential for effective student assessment in health education. However, the manual creation of MCQs is labour-intensive, requiring significant time and expertise. With the increasing demand for large and continuously updated question banks, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, has emerged as a potential tool for automating question generation. While AI-assisted question generation has shown promise, its ability to match human-authored MCQs in terms of difficulty and discrimination indices remains unclear. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of AI-generated and faculty-authored MCQs in radiography education, addressing a critical gap in evaluating AI's role in assessment processes. The findings will be beneficial for educators and curriculum designers exploring AI integration into health education. Methods: This study was conducted in Turkey during the 2024-2025 academic year. Participants included 56 students enrolled in the first year of the Medical Imaging Programme. Two separate 30-question MCQ exams were developed-one generated by ChatGPT-4o and the other by a faculty member. The questions were derived from radiographic anatomy and positioning content, covering topics such as cranial, vertebral, pelvic, and lower extremity radiographs. Each exam contained six questions per topic, categorised into easy, medium, and difficult levels. A quantitative research design was employed. Students took both exams on separate days, without knowing the source of the questions. Difficulty and discrimination indices were calculated for each question, and student feedback was collected using a 5-point Likert scale to evaluate their perceptions of the exams. Results: A total of 56 out of 80 eligible students participated, yielding a response rate of 70 %. The mean number of correct answers are similar for ChatGPT (14.91 +/- 4.25) and human expert exams (15.82 +/- 4.73; p = 0.089). Exam scores showed moderate positive correlation (r = 0.628, p < 0.001). ChatGPT achieved an average difficulty index of 0.50 versus 0.53 for human experts. Discrimination indices were acceptable for 73.33 % of ChatGPT questions and 86.67 % of human expert questions. Conclusion: LLMs like ChatGPT can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human expert questions, though slight limitations in discrimination and difficulty alignment remain. These models hold promise for supplementing assessment processes in health education.

AB  - BackgroundRecent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new avenues in educational methodologies, particularly in medical education. This study seeks to assess whether generative AI might be useful in addressing the depletion of assessment question banks, a challenge intensified during the Covid-era due to the prevalence of open-book examinations, and to augment the pool of formative assessment opportunities available to students. While many recent publications have sought to ascertain whether AI can achieve a passing standard in existing examinations, this study investigates the potential for AI to generate the exam itself.Summary of workThis research utilized a commercially available AI large language model (LLM), OpenAI GPT-4, to generate 220 single best answer (SBA) questions, adhering to Medical Schools Council Assessment Alliance guidelines the and a selection of Learning Outcomes (LOs) of the Scottish Graduate-Entry Medicine (ScotGEM) program. All questions were assessed by an expert panel for accuracy and quality. A total of 50 AI-generated and 50 human-authored questions were used to create two 50-item formative SBA examinations for Year 1 and Year 2 ScotGEM students. Each exam, delivered via the Speedwell eSystem, comprised 25 AI-generated and 25 human-authored questions presented in random order. Students completed the online, closed-book exams on personal devices under exam conditions that reflected summative examinations. The performance of both AI-generated and human-authored questions was evaluated, focusing on facility and discrimination index as key metrics.Summary of resultsThe screening process revealed that 69% of AI-generated SBAs were fit for inclusion in the examinations with little or no modifications required. Modifications, when necessary, were predominantly due to reasons such as the inclusion of "all of the above" options, usage of American English spellings, and non-alphabetized answer choices. 31% of questions were rejected for inclusion in the examinations, due to factual inaccuracies and non-alignment with students' learning. When included in an examination, post hoc statistical analysis indicated no significant difference in performance between the AI- and human- authored questions in terms of facility and discrimination index.Discussion and conclusionThe outcomes of this study suggest that AI LLMs can generate SBA questions that are in line with best-practice guidelines and specific LOs. However, a robust quality assurance process is necessary to ensure that erroneous questions are identified and rejected. The insights gained from this research provide a foundation for further investigation into refining AI prompts, aiming for a more reliable generation of curriculum-aligned questions. LLMs show significant potential in supplementing traditional methods of question generation in medical education. This approach offers a viable solution to rapidly replenish and diversify assessment resources in medical curricula, marking a step forward in the intersection of AI and education.

AB  - Notwithstanding the growing advantages of incorporating Augmented Reality (AR) in science education, the pedagogical use of AR combined with Pedagogical Agents (PAs) remains underexplored. Additionally, few studies have examined the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into science education to create GAI-enhanced PAs (GPAs) that enrich the learning experiences. To address these gaps, this study designed and implemented a GPA-enhanced 5E model within AR environments to scaffold students' science learning. A mixed-methods design was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on students' academic achievement, cognitive load, and their perceptions of GPAs as learning aids through using the 5E model. Sixty sixth-grade students from two complete classes were randomly assigned to either an experimental group engaged in AR science learning with a GPA-enhanced 5E approach or a control group that followed the traditional 5E method. The findings revealed that the GPA-enhanced 5E approach in AR environments significantly improved students' academic achievement and decreased cognitive load. Furthermore, students in the experimental group reported positive perceptions of the GPA-enhanced 5E method during the AR science lessons. The findings offer valuable insights for instructional designers and educators who leverage advanced educational technologies to support science learning aligned with constructivist principles.

AB  - In diverse classrooms, one of the challenges educators face is creating assessments that reflect the different cultural backgrounds of every student. This study presents a novel approach to the automatic generation of cultural and context-specific science assessments items for K-12 education using generative AI (GenAI). We first developed a GenAI Culturally Responsive Science Assessment (GenAI-CRSciA) framework that connects CRSciA, specifically key cultural tenets such as indigenous language, Indigenous knowledge, ethnicity/race, and religion, with the capabilities of GenAI. Using the CRSciA framework, along with interactive guided dynamic prompt strategies, we developed the CRSciA-Generator tool within the OpenAI platform. The CRSciA-Generator allows users to automatically generate assessment items that are customized to align with their students' cultural and contextual needs. We further conducted a pilot demonstration of item generation between the CRSciA-Generator and the base GPT-4o using standard prompts. Both tools were tasked with generating CRSciAs that aligned with the Next Generation Science Standard on predator and prey relationship for use with students from Ghana, the USA, and China. The results showed that the CRSciA-Generator output assessment items incorporated more tailored cultural and context assessment items for each specific group with examples, such as traditional stories of lions and antelopes in Ghana, Native American views on wolves in the USA, and Taoist or Buddhist teachings on the Amur tiger in China compared to the standard prompt assessment items within the base GPT-4o. However, due to the focus on nationality in the pilot demonstration, the CRSciA-Generator assessment items treated the countries as culturally homogeneous, overlooking subcultural diversity in these countries. Therefore, we recommend that educators provide detailed background information about their students when using the CRSciA-Generator. We further recommend future studies involving expert reviews to assess the cultural and contextual validity of the assessment items generated by the CRSciA-Generator.

AB  - This study explores the integration of generative AI (GenAI) tools in the professional development of English language teachers (ELT) using the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework. Subscribing to narrative inquiry research design, in-depth interviews were conducted with four educators in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, in August 2024 to understand their experiences integrating GenAI in teaching practices. Four themes were identified using thematic analysis-enhanced teaching skills and methods, professional growth as a continuous learning process, GenAI dependency, and ethical challenges and coping mechanisms for further discussion. The findings disclose that GenAI enhances pedagogical strategies by providing personalized learning resources, dynamic classroom activities, and automated feedback, which foster student engagement and teacher adaptability. Participants noted that GenAI supports continuous professional growth by offering real-time insights to refine instructional methods and address diverse learner needs. However, challenges such as technical skill gaps, ethical concerns about data privacy, and the risk of over-reliance on AI, which may hinder critical thinking and teacher-student rapport, were identified. The study emphasizes the need to balance GenAI's technological benefits with human-centric pedagogy, underlining the importance of ethical guidelines, institutional training, and collaborative peer learning to reduce the dependency and algorithmic biases by aligning GenAI integration with TPACK principles-harmonizing technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge-the research advocates for structured support systems to empower educators in using AI responsibly. The implications call for policy frameworks prioritizing AI literacy, equitable access, and mindfulness practices to sustain professional development while preserving the irreplaceable role of human interaction in education.

AB  - This study examined the guidelines issued by the top 50 U.S. universities regarding the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in academic and administrative activities. Employing a mixed methods approach, the research combined topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and qualitative thematic analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of institutional responses to GenAI. Topic modeling identified four core topics: Integration of GenAI in Learning and Assessment, GenAI in Visual and Multimodal Media, Security and Ethical Considerations in GenAI, and GenAI in Academic Integrity. These themes were further explored through sentiment analysis, which revealed highly positive attitudes towards GenAI across all institution types, with significant differences between faculty and student-targeted guidelines. Qualitative thematic analysis corroborated these findings and provided deeper insights, revealing that 94% of universities had faculty guidelines emphasizing the importance of establishing and communicating course-specific GenAI policies. This analysis also highlighted recurring themes such as academic integrity and privacy concerns, which aligned with the security and ethical considerations identified in the topic modeling. The study highlights the rapid evolution of GenAI guidelines in higher education and the need for flexible, stakeholder-specific policies that address both the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology.

AB  - The launch of new tools in late 2022 heralded significant growth in attention to the impacts of generative AI (GenAI) in education. Claims of the potential impact on education are contested, but there are clear risks of inappropriate use particularly where GenAI aligns poorly with learning aims. In response, in mid-2023, the Australian Federal Government held an inquiry, calling for public submissions. This inquiry offers a lens onto the policy framing of GenAI in education and provides the object of investigation for this paper. We use the inquiry submissions, extracting structured claims from each. This extraction is provided as an open data set for further research, while this paper focuses on our analysis of the policy recommendations made.

AB  - The examination of the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on higher education, especially from the viewpoint of students, is gaining significance. Although prior research has underscored GenAI's potential advantages in higher education, there exists a discernible research gap concerning the determinants that affect its adoption. In the present study, we aim to enhance our comprehension of the factors influencing the willingness of higher education students to adopt GenAI tools. To achieve this, we have developed an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model incorporating specific GenAI constructs. Our research methodology entailed the selection of a diverse sample of 374 students through random sampling. We then analyzed their data using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to gain insights into the complex relationships between various variables. The study found that students are more likely to use GenAI tools when they view them as supplemental resource and effort expectancy. It also revealed that perceived costs negatively impact adoption intentions, highlighting that financial factors are a significant barrier. Interestingly, Factors like information accuracy and hedonic motivation did not significantly affect students' adoption intentions. This study offers key insights for eLearning practitioners on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools into educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of resource perception and effort expectancy, demonstrating GenAI's potential to personalize learning experiences. eLearning platforms can utilize GenAI to enhance active learning through engaging methods and streamline course development. Addressing cost barriers is crucial for equitable access and inclusivity. A gradual approach to integration aligned with learning objectives is recommended, along with fostering critical engagement with GenAI tools to enhance digital literacy. Lastly, the study is constrained by its specific context, potential biases in self-reported data, a narrow focus on factors influencing students' intent to use GenAI tools and a cross-sectional design. Future research should encompass a broader range of factors, employ objective measures, and integrate observational data. Longitudinal studies or experimental designs could offer more comprehensive insights into how students' perceptions and intentions develop, thus promoting a more inclusive educational environment for all students.

AB  - This paper explores the integration of generative AI (GenAI) in the feedback process in higher education through a learning analytics (LA) tool, examined from a feedback literacy perspective. Feedback literacy refers to students' ability to understand, evaluate, and apply feedback effectively to improve their learning, which is crucial for fostering self-regulated learning and academic growth. GenAI has the potential to open new avenues of research and design in augmenting feedback practices by providing innovative, personalized, and scalable feedback solutions. The study investigates how GenAI functionalities, specifically ChatGPT explanation features and GenAI-powered dashboard visualizations, can support students in engaging with feedback. Using feedback literacy theory, a thematic analysis was conducted and triangulated with usage trace data to assess students' perceptions of these functionalities. The study involved three key activities: introductory lab sessions, in-semester use of the GenAI-powered LA feedback tool, and post hoc interviews, with data collected from 18 students from various disciplines (information technology, education, business and economics, and engineering) throughout all phases. Initial findings from the lab sessions showed positive perceptions of the GenAI functionalities. However, trace data from in-semester use indicated modest engagement with GenAI. Post hoc interviews revealed that reduced engagement was due to a mismatch between the GenAI outputs and student expectations. While some students appreciated the GenAI functionalities, others found them redundant when they perceived the feedback as clear and easy to understand. This study highlights the potential of GenAI in the feedback process and underscores the challenges of aligning AI tools with diverse student needs. Future developments should focus on creating adaptive and discipline-specific GenAI solutions.

AB  - Teachers who wish to enact lessons about generative AI are required to simultaneously learn about it and develop curricula with activities that align with their discipline. We present two cases of high school teachers, June and Margot, who had different prior experiences, resources, and learning goals related to GenAI instruction. We found that they designed lessons that positioned GenAI as an object-of-study or subject-specific, but neither lesson solely focused on either approach. Prior disciplinary and lesson planning knowledge and in-the moment student reactions to activities shaped their appraisals of lesson effectiveness. However, we observed that co-design experiences and activities were central for helping to develop teachers' pedagogical design capacity for GenAI. We contribute two cases that illustrate how co-design can support high school teachers who wish to integrate GenAI into their discipline, and by offering contrasting models of pedagogical approaches.

AB  - This study explores how socio-cultural dynamics influence student engagement with Generative AI technology in Nigerian higher education, using activity theory as theoretical underpinning. By examining the roles of community norms, technological accessibility, and educational objectives, the research identifies critical factors that impact the adoption and utilisation of GenAI. We employ quantitative analysis to analyse 899 survey responses from students across seventeen (17) Nigerian universities to derive interesting insights. Findings reveal that the ease of use of GenAI tools and their alignment with educational goals enhance student engagement. Conversely, regular need for technical support negatively affect engagement, suggesting underlying technological issues.

AB  - While Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies like ChatGPT are revolutionizing education by offering unique interaction opportunities and prompting legislative shifts toward AI literacy, there remains a significant gap in understanding the factors that influence their acceptance and effective use in educational settings. In particular, the impact of students' digital competencies and motivational factors on their acceptance and utilization of GenAI tools is not well understood. This study investigates how these variables influence undergraduate students' acceptance and use of ChatGPT as an informal learning tool, aiming to advance understanding of GenAI adoption in higher education. By integrating the Digital Competence Framework (DigComp) with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), this research provides a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting students' intention to use and actual use of ChatGPT. Data were collected from 544 undergraduate students using adapted UTAUT2 scales and digital competence measures aligned with DigComp. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (n = 140) validated the adapted UTAUT2, and Structural Equation Modeling (n = 404) explored relationships between variables. The findings reveal that habit, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and facilitating conditions significantly predict students' intention to use ChatGPT, while behavioral intention, problem-solving skills, and ethical considerations positively influence actual use. Notably, the study highlights the critical role of problem-solving and ethical awareness-in the adoption of GenAI tools. These results suggest that existing digital competence frameworks may need updating to include GenAI-specific competencies such as prompt-writing skills, managing ongoing dialogs with GenAI tools, and critically evaluating AI-generated content.

AB  - Background Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has significant potential implications for pharmacy education, but its ethical, practical, and pedagogical implications have not been fully explored. Aim This international study evaluated pharmacy students' acceptance and use of GenAI tools using the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Method A cross-sectional survey of pharmacy students from nine countries during the first half of 2024 assessed GenAI usage patterns, curricular integration, and acceptance via the Extended UTAUT framework. After appropriate translation and cultural adaptation, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified key adoption factors. Results A total of 2009 responses were received. ChatGPT and Quillbot were the tools most frequently utilised. EFA identified three key dimensions: Utility-Driven Adoption, Affordability and Habitual Integration, and Social Influence. Students rated performance and effort expectancy highly, highlighting their perceived usefulness and ease of use of GenAI tools. In contrast, habit and price value received lower ratings, indicating barriers to habitual use and affordability concerns. Gender disparities were noted, with males demonstrating significantly higher acceptance (p < 0.001). Additionally, country-specific differences were evident, as Malaysia reported a high performance expectancy, while Egypt exhibited low facilitating conditions. Over 20% indicated an over-reliance on GenAI for assignments, raising ethical concerns. Significant gaps were observed, such as limited ethical awareness-only 10% prioritised legal and ethical training-and uneven curricular integration, with 60% reporting no formal exposure to Generative AI. Conclusion Findings reveal critical gaps in ethical guidance, equitable access, and structured GenAI integration in pharmacy education. A proactive, context-specific strategy is essential to align technological innovation with pedagogical integrity.

AB  - This exploratory study investigates the convergence of marketing communications and AI-powered technology in higher education, adopting a perspective on student interactions with generative AI tools. Through a comprehensive content analysis of learners' responses, we employed a blend of manual scrutiny, Python-generated Word Cloud, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to expose the nature of interaction between learners and AI tools. Our findings indicate that learners predominantly adhere to the perception of AI as a tool resembling a 'brush' in the creative process, rather than as an active co-creator - the percaption that is aligned with the conventional tool-user dynamic. Students articulated a dual narrative regarding AI: they acknowledged its utility in enhancing creativity, yet expressed concerns about overreliance potentially eroding their own creative skills. Heidegger's exploration of different modes of 'revealing' and Deleuze and Guattari's notions of desiring machines and machinic enslavement suggest an alternative perspective where technology, and by extension AI-empowered technology, can contribute to a deeper existential understanding. This study points out the possibility of moving beyond a simple tool-user model, suggesting the emergence of more complex plausible scenarios of interaction: poietic symbiosis or algorithmic subjugation.

AB  - This study aims to examine how to integrate generative AI (GenAI) into marketing education. We used the transformation mechanism within boundary crossing theory to explore how marketing professional insights can be utilized to prepare students for industry demands in the GenAI era. We analyze industry content and GenAI courses alongside 26 interviews with industry practitioners to identify essential knowledge, skillsets, and optimal strategies for implementing GenAI in marketing curricula. Findings underscore the necessity of equipping students with GenAI skills for marketing research, strategy development, content creation, creativity, and ideation across use cases. Practitioners emphasized that marketing theory and ethics should be centralized in any GenAI-related subject matter. For educators, the study highlights the importance of involving industry partners, integrating external materials, and offering master classes to ensure students develop practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge. This research contributes to the discourse on GenAI in marketing education by providing use-cases and actionable insights into subject design, ensuring alignment with industry expectations and equipping students with necessary competencies for a GenAI-driven marketing environment. We extend the application of Boundary Crossing theory into marketing education literature by theorizing how transformation deepens and operates bidirectionally in the context of disruptive technologies, such as GenAI.

AB  - The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has come along with multiple benefits in education (e.g., 24h teacher, augmenting student monitoring). However, at the same time, these tools hinder teachers' autonomy, limiting the capacity and freedom to exert control over students' actions and their learning process. Additionally, the generic character of the GenAI output usually lacks contextualization (e.g., course curriculum, students' age), thus hampering the successful attainment of the course goals. To address these issues, this paper proposes the development of a system mediating between the GenAI interfaces and their back-ends. This system allows teachers to monitor the students' interactions and align the given answers with the course learning objectives and teaching methods. This research follows the Systems Development Research methodology, and within the first iteration, we developed a system prototype that was evaluated with 8 secondary-school teachers. Results showed a high perceived usefulness of the system for monitoring students' interactions; for alerting the teachers to take specific actions (e.g., suspicious copy-paste behaviours), and for having control over the GenAI outputs. Additionally, while most teachers perceived a higher autonomy level within the given scenarios, some teachers did not. The evaluation also served to collect further requirements and usability features to keep improving the tool in the next methodological iterations.

AB  - PurposeIn 2022 generative AI took the Internet world by storm. Free access to tools that can generate text and images that pass for human creations triggered fiery debates about the potential uses and misuses of generative AI in education. There has risen a need to check the popular utopian and dystopian narratives about AI against the diversity of hopes, concerns and future imaginaries that educators themselves associate with generative AI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perspectives of Finnish teacher educators on the use of AI in education.Design/methodology/approachThis article reports findings from a hands-on workshop in teacher training, where participants learned about how generative AI works, collaboratively explored generative AI and then reflected on its potential and challenges.FindingsThe results reveal nuanced, calm and thoughtful imaginaries rooted in deep understanding of educational policy, evaluation and the sociocultural context of education. The results cover teachers' views on the impact of AI on learners' agency, metacognition, self-regulation and more.Originality/valueThis article offers a unique exploration into the perceptions and imaginaries of educators regarding generative AI in specific (instead of "monolithic AI"), moving beyond dystopian views and instead focusing on the potential of AI to align with existing pedagogical practices. The educators contrasted the common techno-deterministic narratives and perceived AI as an avenue to support formative assessment practices and development of metacognition, self-regulation, responsibility and well-being. The novel insights also include the need for AI education that critically incorporates social and ethical viewpoints and fosters visions for a future with culturally, socially and environmentally sustainable AI.

AB  - Programming is essential in K-12 education and fosters computational thinking skills. Given the complexity of programming and the advanced skills it requires, previous research has introduced user-friendly tools to support young learners. However, our interviews with six programming educators revealed that current tools often fail to reflect classroom learning objectives, offer flexible guidance, and foster creativity. Therefore, we introduced MindScratch, a multimodal generative AI (GAI)-powered visual programming support tool. MindScratch aims to balance structured classroom activities with free programming creation, supporting students in completing creative programming projects based on teacher-set learning objectives while also providing programming scaffolding. The results indicate that, compared to the baseline, MindScratch more effectively helps students achieve high-quality projects aligned with learning objectives. It also enhances students' computational thinking and thinking. Overall, we believe that GAI-driven educational tools like MindScratch offer students a focused and engaging learning experience.

AB  - Within the rapid integration of AI into educational settings, understanding its impact on essential cognitive skills is crucial for developing effective teaching strategies and improving student outcomes. This study examines the influence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills in higher education. Our research specifically investigates how the perceived ease of use, usefulness, and learning value of GenAI tools might influence students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and whether self-regulation serves as a mediator in this relationship. Utilising a quantitative approach, we surveyed 223 students and analysed their responses using a structural equation modelling method. The results reveal that the ease of use of GenAI significantly enhances self-regulation, which in turn positively impacts both the critical thinking and problem-solving abilities of students. However, the perceived usefulness and learning value of GenAI were not found to significantly influence these skills through self-regulation. These findings suggest that, while AI tools can offer an environment conducive to developing higher-order cognitive skills, this might not necessarily translate to the enhancement of students' skills. This research contributes to the ongoing literature on the role of technology in education by highlighting the importance of designing GenAI tools that support self-regulated learning. Furthermore, it calls for educators and developers to focus not just on the functionality of AI, but also on how these tools can be integrated into curricula to effectively support critical thinking and problem-solving. The practical implications of our research highlight the need for AI tools that are user-friendly and aligned with educational goals, enhancing their adoption and effectiveness in improving student outcomes. It is crucial for educators to integrate strategies that promote self-regulation within AI-enhanced learning environments to maximise their impact on student learning.

This study examines EFL learners' continuance intention to use GenAI for language learning through PLS-SEM and fsQCA methodologies. Participants were undergraduate EFL learners (N = 383) from three universities in Taiwan, aged 18-24, with varying English proficiency levels (TOEIC 450-860 or CEFR A2-B2). Data were collected through an online survey comprising validated scales measuring technology acceptance constructs and personality traits using 5-point Likert scales. Analysis employed both partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Results showed that three key dimensions - dependability, attractiveness and novelty - shape users' overall experience with GenAI, where dependability and attractiveness specifically align with users' initial expectations. Both expectancy confirmation and social influence predict learners' continuance intention. Openness to experience moderates these relationships positively for expectancy confirmation but negatively for social influence, indicating that individuals with high openness prioritise personal evaluation over social cues. As the first study to combine PLS-SEM with fsQCA in GenAI use research, it reveals complementary insights: while PLS-SEM identifies key predictors of continued use, fsQCA uncovers multiple pathways to adoption, with dependability and social influence as core conditions across configurations. This dual-method approach advances theoretical understanding of technology adoption by demonstrating how linear relationships coexist with complex configurational patterns. The findings provide practical implications for educational technology design, emphasising the need to balance system reliability and aesthetic appeal while accounting for individual differences in user personality traits.

KW  - ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
KW  - CHATGPT
AB  - BackgroundGenerative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly integrated into health professions education (HPE), offering new opportunities for student learning. However, current research lacks a comprehensive understanding of how HPE students actually use GenAI in practice. Laurillard's Conversational Framework outlines six learning types-acquisition, inquiry, practice, production, discussion and collaboration-commonly used to categorise learning activities supported by conventional and digital technologies. Gaining insight into how GenAI aligns with these six learning types could assist HPE academics in integrating it more thoughtfully and effectively into teaching and learning.PurposeThis systematic review investigates how HPE students utilise GenAI and examines how these uses align with Laurillard's six learning types compared to conventional and digital technologies.Material and MethodsA systematic review searching five major databases-ERIC, Education Database, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Scopus including articles on HPE students' use of GenAI until 15th September 2024. Studies were included if they were conducted within formal HPE training programs in HPE and specifically mentioned how students interact with GenAI. Data were mapped to the six learning modes of the Laurillard's Framework. Study quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI).ResultsThirty-three studies met inclusion criteria. GenAI supported learning most frequently in practice (73%), inquiry (70%), production (67%) and acquisition (55%). These studies highlight GenAI's varied educational applications, from clarifying complex concepts to simulating clinical scenarios and generating practice materials. Discussion and collaboration were less represented (12% each), suggesting a shift toward more individualised learning with GenAI. The findings highlight benefits such as efficiency and accessibility, alongside concerns about critical thinking, academic integrity and reduced peer interaction.ConclusionThis review has provided insights into HPE students' learning aligned with Laurillard's existing six learning types. Although GenAI supports personalised and self-directed learning, its role in collaborative modes is under-explored.

AB  - This essay accounts for a novel way to explore generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications for digital methods research, based on the AI Methodology Map. The map is a pedagogical resource and a theoretical framework designed to structure, visually represent, and explore GenAI web-based applications. As an external object, the map functions as a valuable teaching material and interactive toolkit. As a theoretical framework, it is embodied in a static representation that provides principles for engaging with GenAI. Aligned with digital methods' practical, technical, and theoretical foundations, the map facilitates explorations and critical examinations of GenAI and is supported by visual thinking and data practice documentation. The essay then outlines the map principles, its system of methods, educational entry points, and applications. The organization is as follows: First, we review GenAI methods, discussing how to access them, and their current uses in social research and the classroom context. Second, we define the AI Methodology Map and unpack the theory it embodies by navigating through the three interconnected methods constituting it: making room for, repurposing and designing digital methods-oriented projects with GenAI. Third, we discuss how the map bridges GenAI concepts, technicity, applications and the practice of digital methods, exposing its potential and reproducibility in educational settings. Finally, we demonstrate the AI Methodology Map's application, employing a digital methodology to analyze algorithmic race stereotypes in image collections generated by nine prominent GenAI apps. In conclusion, the essay unveils methodological challenges, presenting provocations and critiques on repurposing GenAI for social research. By encompassing practice, materiality and theoretical perspective, we argued that the AI Methodology Map bridges theoretical and empirical engagement with GenAI, serving them together or separately, thus framing the essay's main contribution. We expect that the AI Methodology Map's reproducibility will likely lead to further discussions, expanding those we present here.

AB  - The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into health professions education is revolutionizing traditional teaching methodologies and enhancing learning experiences. This study explores the use of generative AI to aid occupational therapy (OT) students in intervention planning. OT students often lack the background knowledge to generate a wide variety of interventions, spending excessive time on idea generation rather than clinical reasoning, practice skills, and patient care. AI can enhance creative ideation but students must still adhere to evidence-based practice, patient safety, and privacy standards. Students used ChatGPT v. 3.5 in a lecture and assignment to integrate generative AI into intervention planning. Students analyzed a case study, generated ideas with ChatGPT, selected interventions that aligned with the client's needs, and provided a rationale. They conducted evidence-based searches and wrote an analysis on how the research influenced their decisions. The results demonstrate generative AI's potential as a valuable tool for OT students, enhancing their comfort with AI and understanding of ethical and safety considerations. Qualitative feedback highlighted AI's role in boosting efficiency and creativity in intervention planning, with most students expressing strong intent to use ChatGPT in clinical practice due to its ability to reduce cognitive load and generate innovative ideas. These findings suggest that integrating generative AI into the OT curriculum could enhance intervention planning and improve clinical readiness.

CP  - 2024 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society
AB  - LLMs and other forms of generative AI have shown immense promise in producing highly accurate epistemic judgements in domains as varied as law, education, and medicine - with GPT notably passing the legal Bar exam and various medical licensing exams. The safe extension of LLMs into safety-critical professional domains requires assurance not only of epistemic but ethical alignment. This paper adopts a theoretical and philosophical approach, drawing from metaethical theories to argue for a distinction hinging around quantitative, axiological comparability that separates Kantian ethics from not only the utilitarianism it is well-known to oppose, but from just distribution theories as well, which are key to debiasing LLM models. It presents the novel hypothesis that LLM ethical acquisition from both corpus induction and RLHF may encounter value conflicts between Kantian and just distribution principles that intensify as they come into improved alignment with both theories, hinging around the variability by which self-attention may statistically attend to the same characterizations as more person-like or more resource-like under distinct prompting strategies.

AB  - Medical education is rapidly evolving with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through the application of generative AI to create dynamic learning environments. This paper examines the transformative role of prompt engineering in enhancing simulation-based learning in emergency medicine. By enabling the generation of realistic, context-specific clinical case scenarios, prompt engineering fosters critical thinking and decision-making skills among medical trainees. To guide systematic implementation, we introduce the PROMPT+ Framework, a structured methodology for designing, evaluating, and refining prompts in AI-driven simulations, while incorporating essential ethical considerations. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of developing specialized AI models tailored to regional guidelines, standard operating procedures, and educational contexts to ensure relevance and alignment with current standards and practices. The framework aims to provide a structured approach for engaging with AI-generated medical content, allowing learners to reflect on clinical reasoning, critically assess AI-generated recommendations, and consider the potential role of AI tools in medical training workflows. Additionally, we acknowledge certain challenges associated with the use of AI in education, such as maintaining reliability and addressing potential biases in AI outputs. Our study explores how AI-driven simulations could contribute to scalability and adaptability in medical education, potentially offering structured methods for healthcare professionals to engage with generative AI in training contexts.

AB  - Generative AI (Gen AI), exemplified by ChatGPT, has witnessed a remarkable surge in popularity recently. This cutting-edge technology demonstrates an exceptional ability to produce human-like responses and engage in natural language conversations guided by context-appropriate prompts. However, its integration into education has become a subject of ongoing debate. This review examines the challenges of using Gen AI like ChatGPT in education and offers effective strategies. To retrieve relevant literature, a search of reputable databases was conducted, resulting in the inclusion of twenty-two publications. Using Atlas.ti, the analysis reflected six primary challenges with plagiarism as the most prevalent issue, closely followed by responsibility and accountability challenges. Concerns were also raised about privacy, data protection, safety, and security risks, as well as discrimination and bias. Additionally, there were challenges about the loss of soft skills and the risks of the digital divide. To address these challenges, a number of strategies were identified and subjected to critical evaluation to assess their practicality. Most of them were practical and align with the ethical and pedagogical theories. Within the prevalent concepts, " ChatGPT " emerged as the most frequent one, followed by " AI, " " student, " " research, " and " education, " highlighting a growing trend in educational discourse. Moreover, close collaboration was evident among the leading countries, all forming a single cluster, led by the United States. This comprehensive review provides implications, recommendations, and future prospects concerning the use of generative AI in education.

AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has prompted the introduction of novel digital technologies, including mobile learning and metaverse learning, into nursing students' learning environments. This study used text network and topic modeling analyses to identify the research trends in generative AI in nursing education for students and patients in schools, hospitals, and community settings. Additionally, an ego network analysis using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) words was performed to develop a comprehensive understanding of factors that impact the integration of generative AI in nursing education. The literature was searched from five databases published until July 2024. After excluding studies whose abstracts were not available and removing duplicates, 139 articles were identified. The seven derived topics were labeled as usability in future scientific applications, application and integration of technology, simulation education, utility in image and text analysis, performance in exams, utility in assignments, and patient education. The ego network analysis focusing on the SWOT keywords revealed "healthcare", "use", and "risk" were common keywords. The limited emphasis on "threats", "strengths", and "weaknesses" compared to "opportunities" in the SWOT analysis indicated that these areas are relatively underexplored in nursing education. To integrate generative AI technology into education such as simulation training, teaching activities, and the development of personalized learning, it is necessary to identify relevant internal strengths and weaknesses of schools, hospitals, and communities that apply it, and plan practical application strategies aligned with clear institutional guidelines.

AB  - Introduction: The growing presence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in our society, particularly in the educational field, is undeniable. This fact has led to various studies on its implications for learning and teaching. However, as with other technological resources, these implications will depend on how teachers use GenAI. Therefore, it is essential to identify teachers' beliefs regarding the use of GenAI for teaching and learning.
   Methods: To this end, a questionnaire was designed and completed by 321 university teachers. This questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first included questions about the participants' demographic information and a Likert scale on teachers' pedagogical beliefs. The second part consisted of a 32-item Likert scale that evaluated teachers' beliefs about the impact of GenAI on their students' learning and their own teaching. These aspects were reflected through items that considered GenAI as either an educational opportunity or a threat.
   Results: The results showed that, of all the variables analyzed, only pedagogical beliefs and the frequency of previous GenAI use influenced beliefs about GenAI usage. Specifically, teachers with constructivist beliefs saw greater potential in GenAI compared to others. Similarly, teachers who regularly used these technologies had more positive beliefs about their educational use than those who used them sporadically or not at all. Lastly, it was also observed that while teachers valued the positive effects of GenAI on their teaching work, they also considered that its use could be detrimental to the learning processes of their students, making them more superficial.
   Discussion: These findings underline the importance of providing teachers with training focused on constructive approaches that enable them to maximize the potential of GenAI in education. In particular, it is crucial to promote teaching practices that, through student-centered GenAI use, foster active and reflective processes in students, aligned with the competencies demanded by today's society.

AB  - The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its extensive potential for integration into many aspects of health care signal a transformational shift within the health care environment. In this context, medical education must evolve to ensure that medical trainees are adequately prepared to navigate the rapidly changing health care landscape. Medical education has moved toward a competency-based education paradigm, leading the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) to define a set of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) as its practical operational framework in undergraduate medical education. The AAMC's 13 core EPAs for entering residencies have been implemented with varying levels of success across medical schools. In this paper, we critically assess the existing core EPAs in the context of rapid AI integration in medicine. We identify EPAs that require refinement, redefinition, or comprehensive change to align with the emerging trends in health care. Moreover, this perspective proposes a set of "emerging" EPAs, informed by the changing landscape and capabilities presented by generative AI technologies. We provide a practical evaluation of the EPAs, alongside actionable recommendations on how medical education, viewed through the lens of the AAMC EPAs, can adapt and remain relevant amid rapid technological advancements. By leveraging the transformative potential of AI, we can reshape medical education to align with an AI-integrated future of medicine. This approach will help equip future health care professionals with technological competence and adaptive skills to meet the dynamic and evolving demands in health care.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and societies globally. To fully harness this advancement, it is crucial for countries to integrate AI across different domains. Moral relativism in AI ethics suggests that as ethical norms vary significantly across societies, frameworks guiding AI development should be context-specific, reflecting the values, norms, and beliefs of the cultures where these technologies are deployed. To address this challenge, we introduce an intuitive, generative AI based solution that could help governments establish local ethical principles for AI software and ensure adherence to these standards. We propose two web applications: one for government use and another for software developers. The government-centric application dynamically calibrates ethical weights across domains such as the economy, education, and healthcare according to sociocultural context. By using LLMs, this application enables the creation of a tailored ethical blueprint for each domain or context, helping each country or region better define its core values. For developers, we propose a diagnostic application that actively checks software, assessing its alignment with the ethical principles established by the government. This feedback allows developers to recalibrate their AI applications, ensuring they are both efficient and ethically suitable for the intended area of use. In summary, this paper presents a tool utilizing LLMs to adapt software development to the ethical and cultural principles of a specific society.

AB  - This study explores university educators' perspectives on their alignment with artificial intelligence (AI) ethics, considering activity theory (AT), which forms the theoretical underpinning of this study. To do so, 37 educators from a higher education institution were selected to write their metaphors about AI ethics alignment, out of which 11 attended semi-structured interviews, in which they answered some questions about their AI ethics alignment and narrated some experiences. The study reveals diverse and often contradictory perspectives on AI ethics, highlighting a general lack of awareness and inconsistent application of ethical principles. Some educators metaphorised AI ethics as fundamental but difficult to understand, while others pointed to the difficulties of regulating ethical violations. The findings highlight the need for targeted professional development on AI ethics, collaborative policy making and a multidisciplinary approach to promote ethical use of AI in higher education. This study also calls for stronger alignment between educators' personal ethical standards and institutional norms to reduce AI-related risks in educational settings.

AB  - This study focuses on Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its transformative impact on design ideation. Generative AI, recognized for its ability to produce a wide array of design alternatives, has become an important tool in design, reshaping traditional methodologies. It facilitates the generation of novel and diverse design forms, acting as a co-creator in the design process. This technology, through machine learning and pattern recognition, analyzes extensive design datasets, enabling the production of innovative solutions. The utilization of generative AI extends beyond replicating AI-provided solutions; it aids in developing and influencing novel concepts, thus fostering original design solutions. This aligns with the concept of 'reflective practice' in design, where designers iteratively refine concepts through a dialogue between thought and action. The study employed a quasi-experimental design with 40 design students, randomly assigned to two groups of 20 each. Conducted in two phases, each phase involved a distinct urban furniture design task. In Phase 1, Group A was provided with a text-to-image generating AI tool, while Group B was not. In Phase 2, both groups undertook a similar task without AI assistance. This design exercise allowed for examining the influence of AI on creativity and cognitive load. Design outcomes from both tasks were anonymized and evaluated by experienced professionals using the Creative Product Semantic Scale (CPSS), which measures Novelty, Resolution, and Elaboration and Synthesis. Additionally, the NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX) questionnaire assessed cognitive load aspects such as mental demand and effort. Findings suggest that generative AI significantly influences the creative design process, enhancing the quality of design outcomes and reducing cognitive load. The AI group demonstrated better performance in both tasks, indicating the impact of AI tools on design skills. This study underscores the potential of AI tools in design education, balancing cognitive load management with creativity enhancement.

AB  - Help-seeking is an active learning strategy tied to self-regulated learning (SRL), where learners seek assistance when facing challenges. They may seek help from teachers, peers, intelligent tutor systems, and more recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, there is limited empirical research on how learners' help-seeking process differs between generative AI and human experts. To address this, we conducted a lab experiment with 38 university students tasked with essay writing and revising. The students were randomly divided into two groups: one seeking help from ChatGPT (AI Group) and the other from an experienced teacher (HE Group). To examine their help-seeking processes, we used a combination of statistical testing and process mining methods, analyzing multimodal data (e.g., trace data, eye-tracking data, and conversational data). Our results indicated that the AI Group exhibited a nonlinear help-seeking process, such as skipping evaluation, differing significantly from the linear model observed in the HE Group which also aligned with classic help-seeking theory. Detailed analysis revealed that the AI Group asked more operational questions, showing pragmatic help-seeking activities, whereas the HE Group was more proactive in evaluating and processing received feedback. We discussed factors such as social pressure, metacognitive off-loading, and over-reliance on AI in these different help-seeking scenarios. More importantly, this study offers innovative insights and evidence, based on multimodal data, to better understand and scaffold learners learning with generative AI.

AB  - This study investigated the students' perceptions of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in upper-secondary mathematics education. Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model-Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use-influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.

AB  - Reading comprehension is crucial in German as a Foreign Language (GFL) education. Despite its importance, there has been limited scholarly engagement in enhancing reading strategies and materials that align with learners' proficiency levels, as outlined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). The LATILL project aims to address this gap by providing open educational resources tailored to the CEFR levels and a platform based on AI-tools for German as a foreign and second language teachers. A user-centred approach was adopted, utilizing Human-Computer Interaction techniques to enhance usability and the user experience of the LATILL platform. The development and deployment of the LATILL platform represents significant strides in leveraging AI and HCI to support language teaching. This work outlines the efforts to enhance the use of the platform, involving secondary school teachers of German as a foreign language from Ukraine and Spain. Two phases were conducted, one phase for testing the platform following a constructive interaction approach and a second phase for collecting feedback through focus groups.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Integration in TESOL Teacher Education: Promoting a Critical Lens Guided by TPACK and SAMR
T2  - TESOL QUARTERLY
LA  - English
AB  - As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) transforms language education, teacher educators are uniquely positioned to equip teachers with the skills to engage with artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Although AI offers opportunities for automating tasks and personalizing learning, educators must ensure these tools align with pedagogical integrity, equity, and social justice. This Teaching Issue article explores AI integration in TESOL teacher education using the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and the Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR) models. The TPACK model provides a lens for understanding the interplay of technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge, whereas the SAMR model evaluates the transformative potential of AI tools. Through these frameworks, we show how TESOL teacher educators can address AI's critical sociopolitical, ethical, and cultural dimensions in TESOL. Focusing on issues such as bias in feedback, equity in access, and cultural representation, we also provide a roadmap for integrating AI into TESOL teacher education in ways that promote equity and social justice.

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are designed to create or generate content from their trained parameters using an online conversational interface. AI has opened new avenues in redefining the role boundaries of teachers and learners and has the potential to impact the teaching-learning process.Methods In this descriptive proof-of- concept cross-sectional study we have explored the application of three generative AI tools on drug treatment of hypertension theme to generate: (1) specific learning outcomes (SLOs); (2) test items (MCQs- A type and case cluster; SAQs; OSPE); (3) test standard-setting parameters for medical students.Results Analysis of AI-generated output showed profound homology but divergence in quality and responsiveness to refining search queries. The SLOs identified key domains of antihypertensive pharmacology and therapeutics relevant to stages of the medical program, stated with appropriate action verbs as per Bloom's taxonomy. Test items often had clinical vignettes aligned with the key domain stated in search queries. Some test items related to A-type MCQs had construction defects, multiple correct answers, and dubious appropriateness to the learner's stage. ChatGPT generated explanations for test items, this enhancing usefulness to support self-study by learners. Integrated case-cluster items had focused clinical case description vignettes, integration across disciplines, and targeted higher levels of competencies. The response of AI tools on standard-setting varied. Individual questions for each SAQ clinical scenario were mostly open-ended. The AI-generated OSPE test items were appropriate for the learner's stage and identified relevant pharmacotherapeutic issues. The model answers supplied for both SAQs and OSPEs can aid course instructors in planning classroom lessons, identifying suitable instructional methods, establishing rubrics for grading, and for learners as a study guide. Key lessons learnt for improving AI-generated test item quality are outlined.Conclusions AI tools are useful adjuncts to plan instructional methods, identify themes for test blueprinting, generate test items, and guide test standard-setting appropriate to learners' stage in the medical program. However, experts need to review the content validity of AI-generated output. We expect AIs to influence the medical education landscape to empower learners, and to align competencies with curriculum implementation. AI literacy is an essential competency for health professionals.

AB  - This essay examines strategies for thoughtfully integrating generative AI (Gen-AI) into management curricula to enhance student learning while mitigating risks like overreliance. We make the case that outright resistance is counterproductive; instead, management educators should embrace Gen-AI's potential to create more engaging, experiential learning aligned with andragogical principles. We provide a conceptual framework mapping nine Gen-AI objectives to the principles of andragogy. A semester-long course example illustrates this framework in action through AI activities fostering autonomy, competence, and real-world application. Student surveys revealed overwhelmingly positive perceptions of Gen-AI integration and improved exam scores. However, dependence risks remain. The essay discusses strategies to enhance critical thinking, personal growth, and academic integrity. Overall, we propose that prudent Gen-AI adoption can enrich management education, but long-term vigilance regarding overreliance is vital.

AB  - This qualitative study explores the levels of technology acceptance of students and teachers in higher education regarding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in summative assessment. Twelve students and eight teachers of a university expressed their views on a series of hypothetical scenarios. Stimulated recall interviews, using hypothetical scenarios, were conducted with 12 of them, applying convenience sampling. Student and teacher views were aligned regarding technology's potential for efficiency and personalised feedback, while both groups underlined the need for explainability and trust, noting also that a teacher knows more about a student's learning trajectory than a submitted assignment could depict. Both groups also expressed concerns that reach beyond technology performance. For students, introducing AI for summative assessment could break the student-teacher connection, while for teachers such a step could take away opportunities for professional development, as grading is considered an essential skill for them.

AB  - IntroductionAdvances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to new possibilities for AI role-play in classroom settings, where generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and chatbots can potentially simulate interactions with patients. This pilot study aimed to design an AI role-play activity underpinned by constructivist principles, implement the activity in a classroom setting, and evaluate the students' engagement with the activity and usability of the interface.Materials and MethodsThe AI role-play was designed based on a patient presenting to a dental teaching hospital in pain. It comprised two interconnected chatbots intended to simulate a patient consultation and clinical supervisor discussion. The chatbots were built using the open-source framework Streamlit and powered by Chat GPT-4. Second and final-year students from an oral health degree were recruited through convenience sampling. Classroom observations were recorded and final-year students participated in a usability questionnaire to gain insights into their engagement, technical challenges, and suggestions for improvement. Data usage and token costs were collected to assess the AI chatbot's feasibility.ResultsEducator observations noted that AI role-play facilitated peer discussion, highlighted gaps in history-taking, and promoted peer learning. Usability survey feedback (n = 14) suggested that students perceived the AI role-play as authentic and relevant to clinical practice, with 86% strongly agreeing it aligned with real-world dental scenarios. The screen design, navigation, and multimedia integration were highly rated. The approximate costs for the activities were $13.17 (USD) for approximately 20 queries, per 20 students.ConclusionThis study presents a descriptive analysis of the implementation of an AI role-play within the early phases of a design-based research framework. AI role-play activities can be implemented in a classroom setting and are perceived as useful for students to apply skills in taking a pain history. While results showed promise for scalability and authentic learning, future research evaluating the impact of the implementation of these activities on student learning should be explored.

Methodology This comparative study utilized DALL-E2 to generate faces representing 19 distinct residency training specialties, as identified by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), which were then compared to the AAMC's residency specialty breakdown with respect to race and gender. Results Our findings reveal an alignment between OpenAI's DALL-E2's predictions and the current demographic landscape of medical residents, suggesting an absence of algorithmic bias in this AI model. Conclusion This revelation gives rise to important ethical considerations. While AI excels at pattern recognition, it inherits and mirrors the biases present in its training data. To combat AI bias, addressing real -world disparities is imperative. Initiatives to promote inclusivity and diversity within medicine are commendable and contribute to reshaping medical education. This study underscores the need for ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers and foster inclusivity in historically male-dominated medical fields, particularly for underrepresented populations. Ultimately, our findings underscore the crucial role of real -world data quality in mitigating AI bias. As AI continues to shape healthcare and education, the pursuit of equitable, unbiased AI applications should remain at the forefront of these transformative endeavors.

AB  - This research employed metaphor analysis to explore 277 postgraduate students' perceptions of the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in academic writing. All participants were international students, from a total of 14 countries and regions, studying in the United Kingdom. Data collection was carried out in two phases. The first was a survey comprising demographic and metaphor-related questions, and the second involved metaphor checking, in which participants provided screenshots of their interactions with GenAI. The data, which were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, yielded 53 unique metaphors for the concept of GenAI in academic writing. We divided these into four conceptual categories in what we term the 4T Pyramid Model: Technical Support (representative metaphor: high-heeled shoes), Text Development (compass), Transformative Potential (Spider-Man), and Threat (drug). The respondents' academic disciplines influenced their perceptions of GenAI, but overall, the results suggest that most viewed it as transformative, i.e., more than just a writing tool. This study's innovative methodology integrating metaphor analysis with real user interactions offers a framework, aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy, that reveals the multi-level benefits and potential risks of GenAI. It also provides actionable insights for AI literacy education, including strategies for effective prompt design.

AB  - This commentary reflects on the valuable ideas presented by Dr. Batat, particularly her recognition that business education requires a new paradigm to remain relevant in the face of rapidly changing technologies. One of the key ideas in her paper is the shift from "interpretation" to "action," where learners play a more active role in their educational journey. This focus on execution is increasingly important as the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) allows computers to handle much of the data analysis, shifting the human role toward understanding, contextualizing, and executing the insights derived from that analysis. We agree that business education must evolve to emphasize doing-encouraging students to apply an execution mindset and leverage AI to analyze data. With AI's growing ability to identify patterns and perform complex analytics, students should focus on the critical implementation of these insights, turning them into actionable outcomes. While the ability of computers to process and analyze data is growing, humans need to bridge the gap between insights and real-world application. While the need for this paradigm shift is evident, several obstacles must be addressed to make it a reality with measurable benefits. One challenge is that business schools must move beyond prioritizing publications in top-tier disciplinary journals and recognize interdisciplinary contributions that may not always align with traditional disciplinary boundaries. We propose that embracing a broader recognition of scholarship and contributions can foster connections between research and the larger, more complex human challenges that business education needs to address. We also propose that business schools will need to provide support to faculty as they update their teaching pedagogy with strategies for including AI and experiential learning opportunities for students.

TI  - Entrustment and EPAs for Artificial Intelligence (AI): A Framework to Safeguard the Use of AI in Health Professions Education
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - MEDICAL-EDUCATION
KW  - DECISION-MAKING
KW  - FUTURE
AB  - In this article, the authors propose a repurposing of the concept of entrustment to help guide the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health professions education (HPE). Entrustment can help identify and mitigate the risks of incorporating generative AI tools with limited transparency about their accuracy, source material, and disclosure of bias into HPE practice. With AI's growing role in education-related activities, like automated medical school application screening and feedback quality and content appraisal, there is a critical need for a trust-based approach to ensure these technologies are beneficial and safe. Drawing parallels with HPE's entrustment concept, which assesses a trainee's readiness to perform clinical tasks-or entrustable professional activities-the authors propose assessing the trustworthiness of AI tools to perform an HPE-related task across 3 characteristics: ability (competence to perform tasks accurately), integrity (transparency and honesty), and benevolence (alignment with ethical principles). The authors draw on existing theories of entrustment decision-making to envision a structured way to decide on AI's role and level of engagement in HPE-related tasks, including proposing an AI-specific entrustment scale. Identifying tasks that AI could be entrusted with provides a focus around which considerations of trustworthiness and entrustment decision-making may be synthesized, making explicit the risks associated with AI use and identifying strategies to mitigate these risks. Responsible, trustworthy, and ethical use of AI requires health professions educators to develop safeguards for using it in teaching, learning, and practice-guardrails that can be operationalized via applying the entrustment concept to AI. Without such safeguards, HPE practice stands to be shaped by the oncoming wave of AI innovations tied to commercial motivations, rather than modeled after HPE principles-principles rooted in the trust and transparency that are built together with trainees and patients.

AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) in education offers both opportunities and challenges, particularly in the context of student assessment. This study examines faculty members' motivations to redesign assessments for their courses in the Gen AI era and introduces a framework for this purpose. A qualitative methodology was employed, gathering data through semi-structured interviews and focus groups, along with examples of redesigned assessments. Sixty-one faculty members participated in the study, and the data were analyzed using both deductive and inductive thematic approaches. Key motivations for redesigning assessments included maintaining academic integrity, preparing learners for future careers, adapting to technological advancements, and aligning with institutional policies. However, the study also highlighted significant challenges, such as the need for professional development and addressing equity and accessibility concerns. The findings identified various innovative assessment approaches tailored to the requirements of the Gen AI era. Based on these insights, the study developed a conceptual framework titled "Against, Avoid, Adopt, and Explore". Future research is needed to validate this framework and further refine its application in educational contexts.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are poised to have a profound impact on medical education. Medical students, as early adopters of technology and future health care providers, play a crucial role in shaping the future of health care. However, little is known about the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use AI chatbots among medical students in China. Objective: This study aims to explore the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use generative AI chatbots among medical students in China, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. By conducting a national cross-sectional survey, we sought to identify the key determinants that influence medical students' acceptance of AI chatbots, thereby providing a basis for enhancing their integration into medical education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators, policy makers, and technology developers to design and implement effective AI-driven educational tools that align with the needs and expectations of future health care professionals. Methods: A web-based electronic survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via social media to medical students across the country. The UTAUT was used as a theoretical framework to design the questionnaire and analyze the data. The relationship between behavioral intention to use AI chatbots and UTAUT predictors was examined using multivariable regression. Results: A total of 693 participants were from 57 universities covering 21 provinces or municipalities in China. Only a minority (199/693, 28.72%) reported using AI chatbots for studying, with ChatGPT (129/693, 18.61%) being the most commonly used. Most of the participants used AI chatbots for quickly obtaining medical information and knowledge (631/693, 91.05%) and increasing learning efficiency (594/693, 85.71%). Utilization behavior, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, and personal innovativeness showed significant positive associations with the behavioral intention to use AI Conclusions: Chinese medical students hold positive perceptions toward and high intentions to use AI chatbots, but there are gaps between intention and actual adoption. This highlights the need for strategies to improve access, training, and support and provide peer usage examples to fully harness the potential benefits of chatbot technology.

AB  - The use of digital technologies in higher education is continually increasing, leading to changes in language use and presumably altering the language skills needed for academic studies. However, scores from high-stakes English language proficiency (ELP) tests used in postsecondary admissions only ensure the prerequisite level of traditional English skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking). Such tests generally do not directly assess technology-mediated language skills (e.g., using online dictionaries and communicating via text message) that likely facilitate successful degree completion for international students. We present results from a needs analysis survey to re-evaluate the English-medium postsecondary linguistic landscape (i.e., update the target language use domain description), to inform ELP admissions tests. We specifically investigate international student (n = 379) and disciplinary instructor (n = 427) perceptions of the importance and frequency of technology-mediated language skills. Results show that student and instructor responses differ on certain technology-mediated skills, such as typing on a smartphone, underscoring the need to consider diverse perspectives in domain analysis research. Findings may inform how digital ELP admissions tests are developed, and how English for academic purposes curricula are designed, in order to better align test/classroom tasks with the academic language skills postsecondary students need.

AB  - Learning Objects (LOs) have long aimed to make digital education scalable and reusable, yet their alignment with constructivist learning remains contested. This study offers a structured comparison of traditional LO design principles and constructivist learning metaphors-acquisition, participation, and knowledge creation-to examine how emerging research directions position themselves within this educational technology landscape. We analyse how emerging research directions-symbolic AI, generative AI, hybrid AI (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and constructivist-oriented LO research-align with or challenge these learning metaphors. We then explore how these directions influence the relationship between LOs and constructivist pedagogy. Our findings show that while some AI-based approaches reinforce structured, predefined learning, others-and especially constructivist-oriented LO models-support more adaptive, collaborative, and student-centred designs. Empirical findings from teacher interviews reveal that teachers' conceptions of learning vary by context-often defaulting to transmissive models under technological constraints, but aligning more closely with participation and knowledge creation metaphors when reflecting on pedagogical theory. These combined and somewhat surprising findings underscore the need for LO frameworks that are pedagogically flexible-that is, able to support both structured and open-ended designs, adapt to varying teaching contexts, and empower learners through meaningful engagement.

AB  - ChatGPT is a substantial language model developed by OpenAI, rooted in the GPT-3.5 architecture, with the capacity to generate human-like responses to text-based inputs. ChatGPT serves various purposes, encompassing chatbots, customer service, and personal assistants, which can significantly contribute to sustainability initiatives. Its applications range from language translation and content creation to text summarization. Utilizing ChatGPT offers several advantages, notably its rapid response generation, high accuracy, and its capacity to evolve and improve over time, aligning with sustainability goals for efficiency and innovation. In an educational context, ChatGPT can provide invaluable support to students and educators, aiding in tasks such as generating summaries for extensive texts and addressing subject-related queries. For programming education, ChatGPT can assist students with coding assignments by offering suggestions, hints, and even generating code snippets, fostering sustainable coding practices. Nevertheless, employing ChatGPT in coding education presents challenges, particularly the risk of students becoming overly dependent on AI-generated code and failing to grasp fundamental concepts, which can hinder long-term sustainability in the field. To gauge the viability of ChatGPT in programming education and sustainability, we conducted a Likert scale questionnaire with a group of 40 Brazilian students from March to April 2023. Our primary goal was to assess students' interest in utilizing ChatGPT as a tool to face programming challenges and problems. Specifically, we aimed to determine their level of inclination towards relying exclusively on ChatGPT during programming classes. In addition to these objectives, we sought to discern not only the positive and beneficial perceptions of using ChatGPT in the classroom but also to investigate its potential impact on learning outcomes and student engagement. Furthermore, we aimed to explore whether participants would consider transitioning to exclusive reliance on ChatGPT in the context of their programming education. Our study revealed that students recognized ChatGPT as an innovative set of AI tools applicable to various classroom contexts, including programming and computer languages, thereby fostering sustainability in the adoption of AI technology for educational purposes. Notably, a majority of students participating in the study expressed a keen interest in employing this tool as a supplementary educational resource in the classroom, promoting sustainable and enhanced learning experiences.

AB  - This study provides an empirical approach to utilizing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based system for identifying students' university choice factors that impact their matriculation decision. We created an AI-based chatbot that gathered both qualitative and quantitative data from nearly 1200 participants worldwide. The entire human-AI interaction process was managed autonomously by the AI without researcher intervention. We analysed all data collected by the AI and identified relevant matriculation decision factors and themes. The AI collaboration demonstrated remarkable efficacy in streamlining the research workflow by consistently adhering to predefined criteria, eliminating variations and human-induced biases, establishing rapport with participants, and amplifying not just the efficiency and scalability of data collection but also the reliability and generalizability of the research findings. Acquiring such insights into students' university choice factors from such a diversified and large sample may potentially empower policymakers to make informed decisions that synch higher education policies with students' preferences, expectations, and needs, ultimately aiding institutions to improve recruitment and retention strategies leading to better overall performance and outcomes for both students and the institution itself. From an economic perspective, gaining this insight can foster closer alignment between higher education and the job market. By understanding students' aspirations and the influences driving their decisions, institutions can tailor programmes that not only enhance graduates' job prospects but also proactively contribute to economic growth and the development of a highly skilled and committed workforce.

AB  - We discuss transforming STEM education using three aspects: learning progressions (LPs), constructed response performance assessments, and artificial intelligence (AI). Using LPs to inform instruction, curriculum, and assessment design helps foster students' ability to apply content and practices to explain phenomena, which reflects deeper science understanding. To measure the progress along these LPs, performance assessments combining elements of disciplinary ideas, crosscutting concepts and practices are needed. However, these tasks are time-consuming and expensive to score and provide feedback for. Artificial intelligence (AI) allows to validate the LPs and evaluate performance assessments for many students quickly and efficiently. The evaluation provides a report describing student progress along LP and the supports needed to attain a higher LP level. We suggest using unsupervised, semi-supervised ML and generative AI (GAI) at early LP validation stages to identify relevant proficiency patterns and start building an LP. We further suggest employing supervised ML and GAI for developing targeted LP-aligned performance assessment for more accurate performance diagnosis at advanced LP validation stages. Finally, we discuss employing AI for designing automatic feedback systems for providing personalized feedback to students and helping teachers implement LP-based learning. We discuss the challenges of realizing these tasks and propose future research avenues.

TI  - GPT-4 generates accurate and readable patient education materials aligned with current oncological guidelines: A randomized assessment
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - ENFORTUMAB VEDOTIN
AB  - Introduction and aim Guideline-based patient educational materials (PEMs) empower patients and reduce misinformation, but require frequent updates and must be adapted to the readability level of patients. The aim is to assess whether generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide readable, accurate, and up-to-date PEMs that can be subsequently translated into multiple languages for broad dissemination. Study design and methods The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for prostate, bladder, kidney, and testicular cancer were used as the knowledge base for GPT-4 to generate PEMs. Additionally, the PEMs were translated into five commonly spoken languages within the European Union (EU). The study was conducted through a single-blinded, online randomized assessment survey. After an initial pilot assessment of the GenAI-generated PEMs, thirty-two members of the Young Academic Urologists (YAU) groups evaluated the accuracy, completeness, and clarity of the original versus GPT-generated PEMs. The translation assessment involved two native speakers from different YAU groups for each language: Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. The primary outcomes were readability, accuracy, completeness, faithfulness, and clarity. Readability was measured using Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease (FKRE), Flesch Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning Fog (GFS) scores and Smog (SI), Coleman Liau (CLI), Automated Readability (ARI) indexes. Accuracy, completeness, faithfulness, and clarity were rated on a 5-item Likert scale. Results The mean time to create layperson PEMs based on the latest guideline by GPT-4 was 52.1 seconds. The readability scores for the 8 original PEMs were lower than for the 8 GPT-4-generated PEMs (Mean FKRE: 43.5 vs. 70.8; p < .001). The required reading education levels were higher for original PEMs compared to GPT-4 generated PEMs (Mean FKGL: 11.6 vs. 6.1; p < .001). For all urological localized cancers, the original PEMs were not significantly different from the GPT-4 generated PEMs in accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Similarly, no differences were observed for metastatic cancers. Translations of GPT-generated PEMs were rated as faithful in 77.5% of cases and clear in 67.5% of cases. Conclusions and relevance GPT-4 generated PEMs have better readability levels compared to original PEMs while maintaining similar accuracy, completeness, and clarity. The use of GenAI's information extraction and language capabilities, integrated with human oversight, can significantly reduce the workload and ensure up-to-date and accurate PEMs. Patient summary Some cancer facts made for patients can be hard to read or not in the right words for those with prostate, bladder, kidney, or testicular cancer. This study used AI to quickly make short and easy-to-read content from trusted facts. Doctors checked the AI content and found that they were just as accurate, complete, and clear as the original text made for patients. They also worked well in many languages. This AI tool can assist providers in making it easier for patients to understand their cancer and the best care they can get.

AB  - D-ID Creative Reality Studio (D-ID) is a platform for creating Artificial Intelligence (AI) presenter (digital human) videos, translating videos, and designing conversational agents. D-ID seamlessly processing (NLP), and speech synthesis and recognition (SSR), offering new possibilities for immersive language teaching and learning. As highlighted in the slogan, "Amaze your audience with your art" (D-ID, 2024), both language learners and teachers can utilise D-ID to create personalised multimodal digital learning resources. Aligning with the interaction hypothesis (Long, 1996), a conversational agent can serve as a language partner, offering accurate linguistic input and facilitating conversational practice anytime and anywhere. Additionally, the incorporation of a digital human is consistent with the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer & Moreno, 2003), which asserts that dual-channel input-integrating visual and auditory modalities-enhances memory retention and overall learning effectiveness. This software review centres on the web-based version of D-ID and provides a detailed analysis of the main features that can contribute to second language acquisition.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in educational settings has garnered significant attention due to its potential to transform learning experiences. The main goal of this study is to analyse the usage, beliefs, and concerns of AI chatbots among university students in Slovenia providing a comprehensive analysis that informs both academic practices and policy-making. We used a structured questionnaire with a sample of 422 participants reflecting a diverse demographic profile across various fields of study. The questionnaire was designed to measure the patterns of AI chatbot usage, students' perceptions and concerns towards AI's potential benefits and drawbacks in education. Statistical analyses, including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the Chi-square test, were utilized to test hypotheses concerning differences in AI chatbot usage, beliefs and concerns based on the level and field of study. The results reveal that Slovenian students are very cautious regarding the capabilities of AI chatbots. A significant majority of students express concern that dependence on AI chatbots could negatively affect two fundamental skills in education: creative writing skills and critical thinking. On the other hand, a majority of students disagree with the statement that over-dependence on AI chatbots could destroy the purpose of education. The findings suggest that there is a critical need to address the educational, ethical, and psychological impacts of AI technologies. The results highlight the necessity for further research into the educational implications of AI, suggesting a balanced and sustainable approach to integrating these technologies into higher education curricula. Such an approach ensures that the adoption of AI not only enhances learning outcomes but also aligns with the principles of sustainability, promoting long-term benefits for both education and society.

AB  - This study aims to examine how generative artificial intelligence adoption and perceived artificial intelligence capacities influence sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions through psychological mechanisms, including perceived desirability and feasibility. Despite growing research interest in sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship, the role of technological enablers, particularly artificial intelligence, in shaping entrepreneurial intentions has been underexplored. To achieve this objective, an advanced approach-polynomial regression with response surface analysis-was employed to test the formulated hypotheses using data from 385 participants. The study further shows that sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions improve significantly when perceived desirability and feasibility are aligned but remain unaffected by misalignment. Generative artificial intelligence adoption and perceived artificial intelligence capacities are shown to directly and indirectly enhance entrepreneurial intentions through perceived desirability and feasibility, highlighting the dual role of artificial intelligence as a practical enabler and psychological motivator. These findings contribute to the extent of entrepreneurial literature by indicating how artificial intelligence technologies foster sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship. Moreover, these findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and organizations by demonstrating how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to promote sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship. By integrating artificial intelligence into entrepreneurial education and policy frameworks, stakeholders can better support the development of sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs and advance global sustainability goals.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This study explores the Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception (KAP) towards ChatGPT among university students and faculty. It also examines the faculty's readiness to cope with the challenges and leverage the opportunities presented by AI-powered conversational models. Background Launched on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT took the world by storm with its capability to generate high-quality written expressions in a conversational manner. The reactions to this innovation varied, from enthusiasm regarding its potential to enrich students' learning to concerns about its threat to students' cognitive development and academic integrity. A systematic exploration of students' and faculty's KAP towards ChatGPT can play an important role in addressing the multifaceted dimensions of AI-driven conversational models. naires distributed to 145 faculty members, as well as 855 undergraduate and graduate students at the ESPRIT School of Engineering and School of Busi- ness. The student sample was based on stratified and convenience sampling, while the faculty sample was based on a consensus sampling approach. Contribution To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported study that contributes to understanding the KAP of students and faculty towards ChatGPT, as well as the readiness of faculty to effectively adopt AI -driven conversational models. Furthermore, our research contributes to the body of knowledge by taking Vygotsky's (1978) principle of social interaction and its role in promoting cogni- tive development to a new level by hypothesizing that if students were to ac- quire the competencies to actively engage with AI -driven chatbots in meaning- ful discussions and collaborative conversations, they might be able to develop some higher -order thinking skills further. Findings Our results indicated that faculty demonstrated a higher level of ChatGPT knowledge than students and that more than 40% of surveyed students and fac- ulty expressed some trust in the reliability of ChatGPT's responses, a perception that does not align with reality. Faculty attitude towards ChatGPT was compar- atively more reserved compared to that of students and showcased varying opinions. Furthermore, the surveyed faculty showcased a more negative percep- tion of ChatGPT than students, and they expressed a greater degree of skepti- cism. Our research revealed that 63.4% of surveyed faculty reported that they lack the requisite training and resources to integrate ChatGPT into their peda- gogical practices. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers HEIs should take appropriate measures to enhance students' and faculty's knowledge, attitude, and perception regarding ChatGPT to stimulate ethical, meaningful, innovative, and engaging interactions and learning experiences. Our study has shed light on some moderating factors that shape the acceptance of AI -driven conversational models and some adoption barriers. It delves into the perceptions, biases, and misconceptions held by both students and faculty, thereby providing a basis for future investigations on the effective integration of AI -driven conversational models in higher education. Impact on Society This research provides new insights that can harness the potential merits of ChatGPT in enhancing students' learning while mitigating potential pitfalls.
   It suggests facilitating open forums and dialogues among students, faculty, em- ployers, and other key stakeholders to debate the impact of AI -driven conversa- tional models on students' learning and faculty's teaching and assessment. Future Research We invite researchers to conduct cross-cultural studies on this topic while also taking into consideration a qualitative research design approach. Future research can also test the hypothesis that AI -driven conversational models inhibit critical thinking by facilitating the passive consumption of information.

AB  - Background The digital transformation in medical education is reshaping how clinical skills, such as point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), are taught. In nephrology fellowship programs, POCUS is essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, guiding procedures, and optimizing patient management. To address these evolving demands, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven POCUS curriculum using a multiagent approach that integrates human expertise with advanced AI models, thereby elevating educational standards and better preparing fellows for contemporary clinical practice. Methods In April 2024, the Mayo Clinic Minnesota Nephrology Fellowship Program initiated a novel AI-assisted process to design a comprehensive POCUS curriculum. This process integrated multiple advanced AI models-including GPT-4.0, Claude 3.0 Opus, Gemini Advanced, and Meta AI with Llama 3-to generate initial drafts and iteratively refine content. A panel of blinded nephrology POCUS experts subsequently reviewed and modified the AI-generated material to ensure both clinical relevance and educational rigor. Results The curriculum underwent 12 iterative revisions, incorporating feedback from 29 communications across AI models. Key features of the final curriculum included expanded core topics, diversified teaching methods, enhanced assessment tools, and integration into inpatient and outpatient nephrology rotations. The curriculum emphasized quality assurance, POCUS limitations, and essential clinical applications, such as fistula/graft evaluation and software integration. Alignment with certification standards further strengthened its utility. AI models contributed significantly to the curriculum's foundational structure, while human experts provided critical clinical insights. Conclusion This curriculum, enhanced through a multiagent approach that combines AI and human collaboration, exemplifies the transformative potential of digital tools in nephrology education. The innovative framework seamlessly integrates advanced AI models with expert clinical insights, providing a scalable model for medical curriculum development that is responsive to evolving educational demands. The synergy between technological innovation and human expertise holds promising implications for advancing fellowship training. Future studies should evaluate its impact on clinical competencies and patient outcomes across diverse practice environments.

AB  - In an ideal world, how individuals learn should align with the methods they are taught. However, this is not always the case, and it is necessary to reconsider the approach to teaching in academic institutions, such as universities, to help students learn at their own pace. Innovative technology plays a vital role in achieving this objective. This study proposes using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to teach in academic institutions. Specifically, an AI-powered conversational bot called Conversational AI Bot for Efficient Learning (COFFEE) is designed, implemented, and will be used as an adaptive learning technology. COFFEE will analyze students' learning habits and adjust the teaching style based on their strengths and weaknesses. Teaching and learning are closely linked to the disciplinary areas of education, behavior, and technology. Combining these areas into a conversational bot equipped with AI algorithms and access to big data makes it possible to disrupt traditional teaching methods. This will benefit students who require special attention, such as those with severe learning disabilities who cannot receive adequate support from instructors due to time constraints or lack of experience. COFFEE is a valuable tool that can be used in academic institutions at all levels, including primary and secondary education. It will be based on the latest advancements in AI and data science and is designed to be feasible, reliable, and customizable.

AB  - Background: Programmatic assessment supports flexible learning and individual progression but challenges educators to develop frequent assessments reflecting different competencies. The continuous creation of large volumes of assessment items, in a consistent format and comparatively restricted time, is laborious. The application of technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI), has been tried to address this challenge. A major concern raised is the validity of the information produced by AI tools, and if not properly verified, it can produce inaccurate and therefore inappropriate assessments. Objective: This study was designed to examine the content validity and consistency of different AI chatbots in creating single best answer (SBA) questions, a refined format of multiple choice questions better suited to assess higher levels of knowledge, for undergraduate medical students. Methods: This study followed 3 steps. First, 3 researchers used a unified prompt script to generate 10 SBA questions across 4 chatbot platforms. Second, assessors evaluated the chatbot outputs for consistency by identifying similarities and differences between users and across chatbots. With 3 assessors and 10 learning objectives, the maximum possible score for any individual chatbot was 30. Third, 7 assessors internally moderated the questions using a rating scale developed by the research team to evaluate scientific accuracy and educational quality. Results: In response to the prompts, all chatbots generated 10 questions each, except Bing, which failed to respond to 1 prompt. ChatGPT-4 exhibited the highest variation in question generation but did not fully satisfy the "cover test." Gemini performed well across most evaluation criteria, except for item balance, and relied heavily on the vignette for answers but showed a preference for one answer option. Bing scored low in most evaluation areas but generated appropriately structured lead-in questions. SBA questions from GPT-3.5, Gemini, and ChatGPT-4 had similar Item Content Validity Index and Scale Level Content Validity Index values, while the Krippendorff alpha coefficient was low (0.016). Bing performed poorly in content clarity, overall validity, and item construction accuracy. A 2-way ANOVA without replication revealed statistically significant differences among chatbots and domains (P<.05). However, the Tukey-Kramer HSD (honestly significant difference) post hoc test showed no significant pairwise differences between individual chatbots, as all comparisons had P values >.05 and overlapping CIs. Conclusions: AI chatbots can aid the production of questions aligned with learning objectives, and individual chatbots have their own strengths and weaknesses. Nevertheless, all require expert evaluation to ensure their suitability for use. Using AIto generate SBA prompts us to reconsider Bloom's taxonomy of the cognitive domain, which traditionally positions creation as the highest level of cognition.

AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of AI-based chatbots on orthodontic patient education in terms of compliance with oral hygiene procedures and level of knowledge and understanding of the treatment recommendations received. Furthermore, to assess the patient's satisfaction with the information received. Materials and methods 100 orthodontic patients were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive information leaflets (control group n = 50) or access to an AI-based chatbot created on the guidelines of the leading scientific societies in the field (n = 50). The plaque index (PI) and modified gingival index (MGI) were assessed at baseline (T0) and after 5 weeks of treatment (T1). A questionnaire with a Likert scale was used to evaluate patients' knowledge and satisfaction. Statistical investigations were conducted to perform intra- and inter-group evaluations and to compare the effects of orthodontic therapies on the independent variables analysed. The questionnaire' s reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Results At T1, a statistically significant increase in MGI and PI was observed in both analyzed groups (P < 0,001). However, the increase in MGI in the chatbot group was statistically lower than in the control group (P < 0.001). The increase in MGI was significantly higher in the chatbot-fixed orthodontic treatment subgroup than in the chatbot-aligners subgroup (P < 0,001). Conclusions The use of AI-based chatbots, whose reliability of the information provided can be validated, positively influences orthodontic oral hygiene in orthodontic patients. Further studies with greater follow-up should be conducted to understand the real impact of AI-based chatbot on patient education and satisfaction.

AB  - Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) education is essential for preparing engineering students to maintain safety standards and prevent workplace hazards. Traditional learning resources, such as textbooks, can be time-consuming and inadequate for immediate, context-specific queries. Advanced AI chatbots offer interactive and immediate feedback, but they often lack specificity and depend on users' prompting skills, which not all students possess. This study introduces "Genie-on-Demand," a custom AI chatbot designed to address students' queries with precise, curriculum-aligned responses. Educators can train the chatbot using specific learning materials by uploading PDFs, ensuring relevant and accurate answers. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 106 electrical engineering students divided into three groups: those using the custom chatbot, those using a conventional chatbot (ChatGPT), and those employing traditional learning methods. Results demonstrated that the custom chatbot significantly improved learning performance, self-efficacy, and technology acceptance compared to other methods. Students reported increased confidence and effectiveness in using the custom chatbot as a learning assistant. This study highlights the potential of customized AI solutions in education, with versatile applications across various disciplines.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has much significance in different industries, including education. Due to increasing technological advancement, universities show their growing concerns about adopting several facilities linked with AI, specifically in their library management systems. Motivated by such an emerging trend, this research was conducted to examine AI adoption in both public and private libraries in China. The study explored the existing landscape of AI- powered services in libraries, the perception of AI benefits, challenges related to AI adoption, and key determinants of such adoption for the targeted libraries. Using a questionnaire technique, the study collected data from different public and private libraries for which a sample of 154 respondents was finalized over the time span of 4.5 weeks. The analysis of the collected data shows that both the situations of launching and planning to launch different AI-related services were observed in Chinese libraries. Moreover, participants also confirmed several benefits of AI, including the enhancement of library operations by improving search accuracy, automating repetitive tasks, offering personalized resource recommendations, revealing usage trends through analytics, curating digital collections, improving cataloging, digitizing rare materials, and providing quick responses via chatbots, thereby allowing librarians to conduct their other more complex tasks. Additionally, the study confirmed several challenges associated with AI adoption.

AB  - Introduction and aimThe surging incidence of type 2 diabetes has become a growing concern for the healthcare sector. This chronic ailment, characterized by its complex blend of genetic and lifestyle determinants, has witnessed a notable increase in recent times, exerting substantial pressure on healthcare resources. As more individuals turn to online platforms for health guidance and embrace the utilization of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT; San Francisco, CA: OpenAI), a text-generating AI (TGAI), to get insights into their well-being, evaluating its effectiveness and reliability becomes crucial. This research primarily aimed to evaluate the correctness of TGAI responses to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inquiries via ChatGPT. Furthermore, this study aimed to examine the consistency of TGAI in addressing common queries on T2DM complications for patient education.Material and methods Questions on T2DM were formulated by experienced physicians and screened by research personnel before querying ChatGPT. Each question was posed thrice, and the collected answers were summarized. Responses were then sorted into three distinct categories as follows: (a) appropriate, (b) inappropriate, and (c) unreliable by two seasoned physicians. In instances of differing opinions, a third physician was consulted to achieve consensus.ResultsFrom the initial set of 110 T2DM questions, 40 were dismissed by experts for relevance, resulting in a final count of 70. An overwhelming 98.5% of the AI's answers were judged as appropriate, thus underscoring its reliability over traditional online search engines. Nonetheless, a 1.5% rate of inappropriate responses underlines the importance of ongoing AI improvements and strict adherence to medical protocols.ConclusionTGAI provides medical information of high quality and reliability. This study underscores TGAI's impressive effectiveness in delivering reliable information about T2DM, with 98.5% of responses aligning with the standard of care. These results hold promise for integrating AI platforms as supplementary tools to enhance patient education and outcomes.

AB  - The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its impact on education has been a topic of growing concern in recent years. The new generation AI systems such as chatbots have become more accessible on the Internet and stronger in terms of capabilities. The use of chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, for generating academic essays at schools and colleges has sparked fears among scholars. This study aims to explore the originality of contents produced by one of the most popular AI chatbots, ChatGPT. To this end, two popular plagiarism detection tools were used to evaluate the originality of 50 essays generated byChatGPT on various topics. Our results manifest that ChatGPT has a great potential to generate sophisticated text outputs without being well caught by the plagiarism check software. In other words, ChatGPT can create content on many topics with high originality as if they were written by someone. These findings align with the recent concerns about students using chatbots for an easy shortcut to success with minimal or no effort. Moreover, ChatGPT was asked to verify if the essays were generated by itself, as an additional measure of plagiarism check, and it showed superior performance compared to the traditional plagiarism-detection tools. The paper discusses the need for institutions to consider appropriate measures to mitigate potential plagiarism issues and advise on the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of AI technology on education. Further implications are discussed in the paper.

This necessitates a re-evaluation of our traditional research and publication ethics, which is the focus of this article. We explore the ethical issues that arise when AI chatbots are employed in research and publication. We critically examine the attribution of academic work, strategies for preventing plagiarism, the trustworthiness of AI -generated content, and the integration of empathy into these systems. Current approaches to ethical education, in our opinion, fall short of appropriately addressing these problems. We propose comprehensive initiatives to tackle these emerging ethical concerns. This review also examines the limitations of current chatbot detectors, underscoring the necessity for more sophisticated technology to safeguard academic integrity. The incorporation of AI and chatbots into the research environment is set to transform the way we approach scholarly inquiries. However, our study emphasizes the importance of employing these tools ethically within research and academia. As we move forward, it is of the utmost importance to concentrate on creating robust, flexible strategies and establishing comprehensive regulations that effectively align these potential technological developments with stringent ethical standards. We believe that this is an essential measure to ensure that the advancement of AI chatbots significantly augments the value of scholarly research activities, including publications, rather than introducing potential ethical quandaries.

TI  - Intelligent links: AI-supported connections between employers and colleges
T2  - AI MAGAZINE
LA  - English
AB  - When modernization and other changes demand workforce reskilling, employers often turn to local colleges for training programs. Doing so can be a frustrating experience. HR and talent professionals have difficulty identifying and communicating requirements, especially for new jobs and roles, while college continuing education (CE) and professional development offices have difficulty understanding and responding to company needs. This article describes an NSF Convergence Accelerator project called SkillSync((TM)) in which multiple forms of AI are used to address this specific problem and provide national efforts (e.g., the US Chamber of Commerce Talent Pipeline Management initiative) with skills data and skills alignment services. Skillsync uses variations on the Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder (SMITH) and other natural language understanding methods to map job descriptions and course information to skills taxonomies, uses machine-learned models to align skills needs with learning outcomes and training, and incorporates an intelligent coach based on Georgia Tech's Jill Watson "virtual teaching assistant" to answer questions about Skillsync's vocabulary, functionality, and process. This article describes these AI methods, how these methods are used in Skillsync, and the challenges involved.

AB  - The recent explosion of technological innovations in mobile technology, virtual reality (VR), digital dissection, online learning platform, 3D printing, and augmented reality (AR) has provided new avenues for improving preclinical education, particularly in anatomy and histology education. Anatomy and histology are fundamental components of medical education that teach students the essential knowledge of human body structure and organization. However, these subjects are widely considered to be some of the most difficult disciplines for healthcare students. Students often face challenges in areas such as the complexity and overwhelming volume of knowledge, difficulties in visualizing body structures, navigating and identifying tissue specimens, limited exposure to learning materials, and lack of clinical relevance. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation by reducing face-to-face teaching opportunities and affecting the availability of body donations for medical education.
   To overcome these challenges, educators have integrated various educational technologies, such as virtual reality, digital 3D anatomy apps, 3D printing, and AI chatbots, into preclinical education. These technologies have effectively improved students learning experiences and knowledge retention. However, the integration of technologies into preclinical education requires appropriate pedagogical approaches and logistics to align with educational theories and achieve the intended learning outcomes.
   The chapter provides practical guidance and examples for integrating technologies into anatomy, histology, and biochemistry preclinical education. The author emphasizes that every technology has its own benefits and limitations and is best suited to specific learning scenarios. Therefore, it is recommended that educators and students should utilize multiple modalities for teaching and learning to achieve the best outcomes. The chapter also acknowledges that cadaver-based anatomy education is essential and proposes that educational technologies can serve as a crucial complement for promoting active learning, problem solving, knowledge application, and enhancing conventional cadaver-based education.

AB  - The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has paved the way for innovative grading practices and assessment methods. This study uniquely explores GPT-4's capabilities in handling essay-based exams in Norwegian across bachelor, master, and PhD levels, offering new insights into AI's potential in educational assessment. Driven by the need to understand how AI can enhance assessment practices beyond traditional approaches, this case study research examines GPT-4's performance on essay-based exams related to qualitative methods, case study research, qualitative meta-synthesis, and mixed method research, using chain-of-thought prompting. Unlike existing studies that primarily assess AI's grading abilities, this research delves into GPT-4's capability to both evaluate student responses and provide feedback, bridging a critical gap in integrating feedback theories with AI-assisted assessment. The study specifically investigates GPT-4's ability to answer exam questions, grade student responses, and suggest improvements to those responses. A case study design was employed, with primary data sources derived from GPT-4's performance on six exams, based on course learning goals and grading scale (feed up), GPT-4's handling of main content in the exams (feedback), and GPT-4's ability to critically assess its own performance and limitations (feed forward). The findings from this intrinsic case study revealed that GPT-4 performs well on these essay-based exams, effectively navigating different academic levels and the Norwegian language context. Fieldwork highlights GPT-4's potential to significantly enhance formative assessment by providing timely, detailed, and personalized feedback that supports student learning. For summative assessment, GPT-4 demonstrated reliable evaluation of complex student essay exams, aligning closely with human assessments. The study advances understanding in the field by highlighting how AI can bridge gaps between traditional and AI-enhanced assessment methods, particularly in scaffolding formative and summative assessment practices. However, since this case study examines only the early phase of the intervention, it has several limitations. With an awareness of its limitations, the findings underscore the need for continuous innovation in educational assessment to prepare for future advancements in AI technology, while also addressing ethical considerations, such as bias. Vigilant and responsible implementation, along with ongoing refinement of AI tools, remains crucial.

AB  - This research investigates how secondary school mathematics educators in the Nsukka Education Zone, Enugu State, Nigeria, perceive the incorporation of artificial intelligence-based ChatGPT into teaching mathematics. The study employed a sequential exploratory mixed-methods strategy, starting with a systematic survey and followed by detailed interviews. The Mathematics Teachers' Awareness and Perceptions of AI-based ChatGPT Questionnaire (MTAPACQ) used in this study was adapted from an existing online survey and administered to 80 mathematics teachers, who were selected using stratified random sampling to ensure varied representation across different local government areas. The survey explored teachers' awareness, utilisation, and perceptions of ChatGPT. Following the quantitative phase, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of five teachers who were familiar with ChatGPT to gain deeper insights into their experiences. The findings indicate limited awareness of ChatGPT, with only 17% demonstrating familiarity with the technology. The infrequent utilisation of ChatGPT in mathematics teaching is mainly associated with this limited awareness. Teachers who integrate ChatGPT report positive outcomes, including improved teaching effectiveness, heightened student engagement, and enhanced comprehension of complex concepts. Nevertheless, the overall perceptions of the tool's impact on mathematics teaching and learning are moderate. The identified challenges in relation to integration include technical adaptability, curriculum alignment, and the need for customisation to accommodate diverse learning styles. This study emphasises the significance of continuous professional development and ongoing support for teachers to integrate AI-based ChatGPT into mathematics instruction proficiently. The insights derived from the findings hold value for educators, policymakers, and technology developers aspiring to elevate the role of artificial intelligence in mathematics education.

Using a dataset of 150 certified supply chain professional questions, the models are evaluated on the basis of accuracy, relevance, and clarity, and t tests are employed to assess differences between the tools. ChatGPT outperforms Bard in both accuracy and relevance, with statistically significant results, whereas Bard demonstrated a slight edge in readability, scoring higher on the Flesch readability ease scale. Both models exhibited moderate to high cosine similarity for the majority of the questions, indicating closely aligned outputs. However, variations in their performance arose from differences in their underlying architectures - ChatGPT's iterative improvement process balances utility and safety, whereas Bard is designed with stricter safeguards to minimize misuse. These findings have important implications for the integration of GAI tools in educational settings, such as developing supply chain curricula and training materials requiring high accuracy and relevance. Additionally, the results suggest broader applications of the GAI in supply chain decision-making, operational efficiency improvements, and enhanced stakeholder communication. The study also highlights the importance of continuous model adaptation to ensure the ethical, safe, and effective use of AI technologies in professional settings. Future research could explore how real-time feedback loops impact AI performance and how diverse training datasets influence model accuracy and relevance across different industries, further advancing the role of AI in complex domains such as supply chain management.

AB  - The release of the generative pre -trained transformer (GPT) series has brought artificial general intelligence (AGI) to the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) field once again. However, the questions of how to define and evaluate AGI remain unclear. This perspective article proposes that the evaluation of AGI should be rooted in dynamic embodied physical and social interactions (DEPSI). More specifically, we propose five critical characteristics to be considered as AGI benchmarks and suggest the Tong test as an AGI evaluation system. The Tong test describes a value- and ability -oriented testing system that delineates five levels of AGI milestones through a virtual environment with DEPSI, allowing for infinite task generation. We contrast the Tong test with classical AI testing systems in terms of various aspects and propose a systematic evaluation system to promote standardized, quantitative, and objective benchmarks and evaluation of AGI.

AB  - BackgroundInterprofessional education (IPE) is essential for promoting teamwork among healthcare professionals. However, its implementation is often hindered by the limited availability of interprofessional faculty and scheduling challenges in creating high-quality IPE scenarios. While AI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being explored for this purpose, they have yet to demonstrate the ability to generate high-quality IPE scenarios, which remains a significant challenge. This study examines the effectiveness of GPT-4o, an advanced version of ChatGPT enhanced by novel methodologies, in overcoming these obstacles.MethodsThis comparative study assessed clinical scenarios generated by GPT-4o using two strategies-standard prompt (a single-step scenario generation without iterative feedback) and iterative refinement (a multi-step, feedback-driven process)-against those crafted by clinical mentors. The iterative refinement method, inspired by actual clinical scenario development, employs a cyclical process of evaluation and refinement, closely mimicking discussions among professionals. Scenarios were evaluated for time efficiency and quality using the Interprofessional Quality Score (IQS), defined as the mean score assigned by multidisciplinary evaluators across five interprofessional criteria: clinical authenticity, team collaboration, educational alignment, appropriate challenge, and student engagement.ResultsScenarios developed using the iterative refinement strategy were completed significantly faster than those by clinical mentors and achieved higher or equivalent IQS. Notably, these scenarios matched or exceeded the quality of those created by humans, particularly in areas such as appropriate challenge and student engagement. Conversely, scenarios generated via the standard prompt method exhibited lower accuracy and various other deficiencies. Blinded attribution assessments by students further demonstrated that scenarios developed through iterative refinement were often indistinguishable from those created by human mentors.ConclusionsEmploying GPT-4o with iterative refinement and role-playing strategies produces clinical scenarios that, in some areas, exceed those developed by clinical mentors. This approach reduces the need for extensive faculty involvement, highlighting AI's potential to closely align with established educational frameworks and substantially enhance IPE, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - Background: Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining individual and public health, positively affecting cognition and well-being, and reducing chronic disease risks. It plays a significant role in driving the economy, public safety, and managing health care costs. Digital tools, including websites, sleep trackers, and apps, are key in promoting sleep health education. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, Microsoft Corp) offers accessible, personalized advice on sleep health but raises concerns about potential misinformation. This underscores the importance of ensuring that AI -driven sleep health information is accurate, given its significant impact on individual and public health, and the spread of sleep-related myths. Objective: This study aims to examine ChatGPT's capability to debunk sleep-related disbeliefs. Methods: A mixed methods design was leveraged. ChatGPT categorized 20 sleep-related myths identified by 10 sleep experts and rated them in terms of falseness and public health significance, on a 5 -point Likert scale. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and interrater agreement were also calculated. A qualitative comparative analysis was also conducted. Results: ChatGPT labeled a significant portion (n=17, 85%) of the statements as "false" (n=9, 45%) or "generally false" (n=8, 40%), with varying accuracy across different domains. For instance, it correctly identified most myths about "sleep timing," "sleep duration," and "behaviors during sleep," while it had varying degrees of success with other categories such as "pre -sleep behaviors" and "brain function and sleep." ChatGPT's assessment of the degree of falseness and public health significance, on the 5 -point Likert scale, revealed an average score of 3.45 (SD 0.87) and 3.15 (SD 0.99), respectively, indicating a good level of accuracy in identifying the falseness of statements and a good understanding of their impact on public health. The AI -based tool showed a sensitivity of 85% and a positive predictive value of 100%. Overall, this indicates that when ChatGPT labels a statement as false, it is highly reliable, but it may miss identifying some false statements. When comparing with expert ratings, high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between ChatGPT's appraisals and expert opinions could be found, suggesting that the AI's ratings were generally aligned with expert views on falseness (ICC=.83, P <.001) and public health significance (ICC=.79, P =.001) of sleep -related myths. Qualitatively, both ChatGPT and sleep experts refuted sleep -related misconceptions. However, ChatGPT adopted a more accessible style and provided a more generalized view, focusing on broad concepts, while experts sometimes used technical jargon, providing evidence -based explanations. Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 can accurately address sleep -related queries and debunk sleep -related myths, with a performance comparable to sleep experts, even if, given its limitations, the AI cannot completely replace expert opinions, especially in nuanced and complex fields such as sleep health, but can be a valuable complement in the dissemination of updated information and promotion of healthy behaviors.

AB  - The current study aims to establish a connection between students' behavioral concerns, namely stress and anxiety, related to the completion of academic tasks, and their integration of technology using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) through the utilization of Chat-GPT via ubiquitous learning (UL) procedure. To achieve this objective, data was collected from 156 students studying management science who were engaged in their final year research projects or internship reports from selected universities in Pakistan. The gathered data underwent analysis through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Smart PLS software. The findings reveal a significant relationship: students' stress contributes to the emergence of anxiety, which in turn motivates the adoption of technology -assisted solutions, specifically Chat-GPT, to efficiently complete assigned tasks within deadlines working through any device from anywhere. Consequently, the perceived ease of use and usefulness associated with Chat-GPT's AI -generated text contribute to shaping students' favorable attitudes toward utilizing Chat-GPT and also play a role in reducing their stress levels. Furthermore, the study confirms that the development of a positive attitude in students acts as a driving force, compelling them to engage with Chat-GPT through ubiquitous learning (UL) procedure, ultimately resulting in increased actual usage of Chat-GPT. This pattern, in turn, contributes to stress and anxiety reduction among management science students. The study's outcomes corroborate the TAM model, which aligns with the social exchange process, demonstrating its applicability within the context of the educational setup in management sciences and its potential to enhance the learning experiences of researchers.

AB  - Background: Although uncertainties exist regarding implementation, artificial intelligence-driven generative language models (GLMs) have enormous potential in medicine. Deployment of GLMs could improve patient comprehension of clinical texts and improve low health literacy. Objective: The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to tailor the complexity of medical information to patient-specific input education level, which is crucial if it is to serve as a tool in addressing low health literacy. Methods: Input templates related to 2 prevalent chronic diseases-type II diabetes and hypertension-were designed. Each clinical vignette was adjusted for hypothetical patient education levels to evaluate output personalization. To assess the success of a GLM (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in tailoring output writing, the readability of pre- and posttransformation outputs were quantified using the Flesch reading ease score (FKRE) and the Flesch-Kincaid grade level (FKGL). Results: Responses (n=80) were generated using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across 2 clinical vignettes. For GPT-3.5, FKRE means were 57.75 (SD 4.75), 51.28 (SD 5.14), 32.28 (SD 4.52), and 28.31 (SD 5.22) for 6th grade, 8th grade, high school, and bachelor's, respectively; FKGL mean scores were 9.08 (SD 0.90), 10.27 (SD 1.06), 13.4 (SD 0.80), and 13.74 (SD 1.18). GPT-3.5 only aligned with the prespecified education levels at the bachelor's degree. Conversely, GPT-4's FKRE mean scores were 74.54 (SD 2.6), 71.25 (SD 4.96), 47.61 (SD 6.13), and 13.71 (SD 5.77), with FKGL mean scores of 6.3 (SD 0.73), 6.7 (SD 1.11), 11.09 (SD 1.26), and 17.03 (SD 1.11) for the same respective education levels. GPT-4 met the target readability for all groups except the 6th-grade FKRE average. Both GLMs produced outputs with statistically significant differences (P<.001; 8th grade P<.001; high Conclusions: GLMs can change the structure and readability of medical text outputs according to input-specified education. However, GLMs categorize input education designation into 3 broad tiers of output readability: easy (6th and 8th grade), medium (high school), and difficult (bachelor's degree). This is the first result to suggest that there are broader boundaries in the success of GLMs in output text simplification. Future research must establish how GLMs can reliably personalize medical texts to prespecified education levels to enable a broader impact on health care literacy.

AB  - Purpose The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of anatomy multiple-choice questions (MCQs) generated by GPT-4, focused on their methodological appropriateness and alignment with the cognitive levels defined by Bloom's revised taxonomy to enhance assessment. Methods The assessment questions developed for medical students were created utilizing GPT-4, comprising 240 MCQs organized into subcategories consistent with Bloom's revised taxonomy. When designing prompts to create MCQs, details about the lesson's purpose, learning objectives, and students' prior experiences were included to ensure the questions were contextually appropriate. A set of 30 MCQs was randomly selected from the generated questions for testing. A total of 280 students participated in the examination, which assessed the difficulty index of the MCQs, the item discrimination index, and the overall test difficulty level. Expert anatomists examined the taxonomy accuracy of GPT-4's questions. Results Students achieved a median score of 50 (range, 36.67-60) points on the test. The test's internal consistency, assessed by KR-20, was 0.737. The average difficulty of the test was 0.5012. Results show difficulty and discrimination indices for each AI-generated question. Expert anatomists' taxonomy-based classifications matched GPT-4's 26.6%. Meanwhile, 80.9% of students found the questions were clear, and 85.8% showed interest in retaking the assessment exam. Conclusion This study demonstrates GPT-4's significant potential for generating medical education exam questions. While it effectively assesses basic knowledge recall, it fails to sufficiently evaluate higher-order cognitive processes outlined in Bloom's revised taxonomy. Future research should consider alternative methods that combine AI with expert evaluation and specialized multimodal models.

AB  - Writing assessment is one of the most important stages in the educational process, but it is also the most resource-demanding one. To address the challenges of scalability and inconsistency, this study proposes a Transformer-LSTM model for automated scoring and feedback generation, enhancing accuracy and reliability in assessment. Integrating the contextual reading abilities of transformers with the sequential analysis strength of LSTMs, the model analyzes significant metrics of writing quality, including grammar, coherence, and structure, while providing individualized, actionable feedback. Using annotated datasets and evaluation metrics like RMSE and feedback relevance, it was established that the model performs well overall and that improvements in grammar and coherence seemed to be the most significant contributors to writing ability. It was also demonstrated that feedback relevance enhances these outcomes, thus confirming its valuable role in promoting structural and grammatical accuracy. Understanding that most existing systems do not encourage significant human feedback, this work demonstrates a scalable approach with potential alignment with human evaluation standards. Finally, this study shows hybrid models' promise for automated writing assessment as promising scalable, equitable, impact-based tools for global enhancement of educational outcomes.

AB  - Objective: We aim to compare the capabilities of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT)-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.0 (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA) in addressing multiple-choice ophthalmic case challenges.Methods and analysis: Both models' accuracy was compared across different ophthalmology subspecialties using multiple-choice ophthalmic clinical cases provided by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) "Diagnosis This" questions. Additional analysis was based on image content, question difficulty, character length of models' responses, and model's alignment with responses from human respondents. chi 2 test, Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted where appropriate, with p<0.05 considered significant.Results: GPT-4.0 significantly outperformed GPT-3.5 (75% versus 46%, p<0.01), with the most noticeable improvement in neuro-ophthalmology (100% versus 38%, p=0.03). While both models struggled with uveitis and refractive questions, GPT-4.0 excelled in other areas, such as pediatric questions (82%). In image-related questions, GPT-4.0 also displayed superior accuracy that trended toward significance (73% versus 46%, p=0.07). GPT-4.0 performed better with easier questions (93.8% (least difficult) versus 76.2% (middle) versus 53.3% (most), p=0.03) and generated more concise answers than GPT-3.5 (651.7 +/- 342.9 versus 1,112.9 +/- 328.8 characters, p<0.01). Moreover, GPT-4.0's answers were more in line with those of AAO respondents (57.3% versus 41.4%, p<0.01), showing a strong correlation between its accuracy and the proportion of AAO respondents who selected GPT-4.0's answer (rho=0.713, p<0.01). Conclusion and relevance: Our study demonstrated that GPT-4.0 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 in addressing ophthalmic case challenges, especially in neuro-ophthalmology, with improved accuracy even in image-related questions. These findings underscore the potential of advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models in enhancing ophthalmic diagnostics and medical education.

AB  - ObjectiveSialendoscopy is a diagnostic and interventional treatment for patients with salivary disease. Patients and physicians leverage website information to acquire knowledge about sialendoscopy; thus, understanding the quality of this information is essential. This study analyzes the quality and readability of online information on sialendoscopy.Methods"Sialendoscopy" was searched on Google, and the first 100 websites were evaluated. Each website was required to meet three criteria for inclusion: accessible when opened, content deemed relevant, and available in written format. Four validated readability and two validated reliability metrics were utilized. Additionally, a separate analysis was conducted for the top nine websites in the search engine, given most web traffic occurs on Google's first page.ResultsIn assessing readability, the mean Flesch Reading Ease Score for included and the top nine websites was 36.2 and 39.5, respectively, with a P-value of .543. Both scores aligned with the "difficult to read" category. Other readability metrics aligned with high school reading levels. For reliability, the mean Discern score for the included and the top nine websites was 36.9 and 45.0, respectively, with a P-value of .030. These scores aligned with the "poor" and "fair" categories, respectively.DiscussionThe low readability and reliability scores implied that the online health information on sialendoscopy is not easily understandable at a reading level appropriate for the general public. Our findings showed that the most readable and highest quality websites were not the highest ranked in our search results. Factors such as search engine algorithms and complex medical terminology used in these informative websites contribute to the lack of readability and relability of online health education.Implications for PracticeAs AI evolves, future studies should be conducted to assess its impact on readability and reliability of online health information. There is an opportunity to adjust search engine algorithms, collaborate with communications specialists, and utilize new technologies, such as artificial intelligence chatbots, for the benefit of health seekers

AB  - Current approaches in education, while aiming to be universally effective, often struggle to fully adapt to the unique needs and communication styles of individual children; this disparity can limit the children's engagement and hinder their learning progress. Similarly, parents or guardians, despite their good intentions, may also be unable to provide consistent and personalized support to each child. In this work, we investigate the use of conversational systems for socially assistive robots (SARs) as a potential solution to this problem, as such systems have the potential to allow children to interact and learn at their own pace, in a way that aligns with their communication preferences. To ensure that the robot's language is suitable for children, we present a system that leverages a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including dialog management, child-friendly language generation, and context-aware response adaptation; to achieve this, our system combines Rasa for dialog management, GPT-3.5 for language generation, and textstat for language complexity evaluation. We evaluate the suitability of the generated language for a young audience through two user studies with adult participants, one in which the conversational system was embodied in a robot and involved direct interaction between a human and a robot, and another where participants evaluated conversational transcripts from the first study. Our results suggest that the system has the potential to maintain engaging and safe conversations, and adapt its language to individual needs.
