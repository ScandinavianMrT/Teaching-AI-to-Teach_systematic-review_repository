N2  - Online learning provides an opportunity for students who are geographically and temporally constrained to access quality education. However, there are significant drawbacks to online learning, such as the lack of timely feedback for students, lack of instructor support, and lack of interaction, which creates a sense of separation between teachers and students. In recent years, a large number of researchers have confirmed the feasibility of pedagogical agents, but most of them are not intelligent enough for the task of immediate feedback. However, new technologies have emerged and large language modeling has been well developed, which excels at communicating with people. By designing a pedagogical agent based on the open-source large language model, each student can get appropriate feedback on their questions and meet their individual needs. Therefore, it is necessary to create one such pedagogical agent. In this paper, an intelligent pedagogical agent is designed in an educational video, and students can call the agent for support at any time as needed.

However, for AI EdTech to be successfully established and widely adopted in higher education, key factors such as maintenance costs and the potential for continuous development should be considered. Therefore, the standardization and development of AI EdTech systems that can be universally applied across universities are essential. In this regard, this study defines the core roles of professors and proposes developmental levels for AI professors to complement these roles. It also outlines the necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each level of AI professor development. These initiatives are expected to play a crucial role in the future standardization and research development of AI EdTech systems.

N2  - In the contemporary digital landscape, the exclusion of digital tools in higher education undermines the essence of learning and advancement. This research delves into the symbiotic relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and education, advocating for the integration of cutting-edge AI language learning tools like ChatGPT to keep pace with innovation. Through innovative methods of integrating generative AI language models, this study proposes a hyperaware curriculum design, fostering a revamped teaching and learning environment. It suggests that by leveraging AI, education can prioritize real-world knowledge application. Rather than viewing education as a static endpoint, this research emphasizes an ongoing process of enlightenment. We propose to situate AI in education as a crucial aspect of multiliteracy pedagogical approach. Through the theoretical lens of the four crucial dimensions of multiliteracy pedagogy by New London Group (1996) including situated practice, overt instructions, critical framing, and transformed practice we postulate each dimension in the light of interweaving it with the integration of technology. As we move towards a future heavily reliant on AI, incorporating AI language models and digital tools into education is imperative.

N2  - In the digital era, Artificial Intelligence is increasingly developing. In recent years, one of the promising development in this field is ChatGPT which has sparked considerable interest. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that allows people to interact with a computer in a more natural and conversational way. It offers students and educators personalized learning experiences Linked to ChatGPt open AI API. Therefore, we present in this paper a virtual tutor, named NAJEH, integrated into the student engagement portal and mobile application (MYU) and have access to the Student Information System (SIS) and Learning Management System (LMS) of the Honoris United Universities11https://honoris.net/, which includes 6 institutions in Tunisia. Around five thousand students from the UniversitÃ© Centrale had the learning experience with NAJEH. A survey was carried out in order to explore students satisfaction and acceptance of NAJEH. Thus, with a 76% response rate, results show that more than 80 % of students find this chatbot tutor very useful, easy and use it at least once a day. As perspective, we propose to investigate on the impact of these interactions on the students' academic performance and teaching efficiency. In fact, an in-depth study requires more data available over a longer period, even several years.

N2  - This research full paper delves into university in-structors' experiences and attitudes toward AI language models, filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators' perspectives on AI's role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding integration of large language models (LLMs) have ignited a debate about their application in education. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness, overall sentiment towards adoption, and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI-based tools in higher education. Data was collected through a survey using a Likert scale, which was complemented by follow-up interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the instructors' viewpoints. The collected data was processed using statistical and thematic analysis techniques. Our findings reveal that educators are increasingly aware of and generally positive towards these tools. We find no correlation between teaching style and attitude toward generative AI. Finally, while CS educators show far more confidence in their technical understanding of generative AI tools and more positivity towards them than educators in other fields, they show no more confidence in their ability to detect AI-generated work.

N2  - This study explores the ethical implications and factors influencing ChatGPT adoption in Indonesian higher education. Indonesia presently leads Southeast Asia in ChatGPT usage due to younger generations who are quick to adopt new technology into their daily life. ChatGPT's growing role in education has resulted in numerous benefits, such as intelligent tutoring systems, personalized help, and adaptable learning experiences that have reshaped the learning process. However, students may become overly dependent on this tool, which could undermine the goal of education by weakening higher-level cognitive abilities like creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking. This research, therefore, set out to evaluate students' knowledge, attitudes, perspectives, concerns, and ethical considerations around ChatGPT usage. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected via an online questionnaire from 512 student respondents and analysed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results showed that four of the five proposed hypotheses were supported and revealed that knowledge of ChatGPT has no significant impact on its usage, whereas students' attitudes did play a critical role. Moreover, ChatGPT usage significantly influenced students' views, concerns, and their perceptions of ethical considerations. This study provides a novel, student-centered perspective on the ethical considerations of AI in education and sparks discussion on establishing appropriate, accountable use of ChatGPT in Indonesia's higher education system.

N2  - The tremendous advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) open new opportunities for education, with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) powered by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) proving to be a promising prospect. Because of this, our work explores state-of-the-art (SOTA) ITS approaches with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve programming education. We investigate whether and how a GenAI-based ITS can effectively support students in learning R programming skills. We measured the performance of three current pairings of LLMs and user interfaces: GPT-3.5 via ChatGPT, PaLM 2 via Google Bard, and GPT-4 via Bing. Therefore, we evaluated the LLMs on four types of problem settings when learning/teaching programming. Our experimental results show that the use of generative AI, specifically LLMs for R programming, is promising, where GPT-3.5 yielded the most satisfactory results. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of our approach are addressed and revealed. Finally, open research directions towards explainable AI (XAI) and integrated self-assessment are pointed out.

N2  - When used in conjunction with education, ChatGPT is a helpful tool for teaching and understanding fundamental concepts. Students who struggle to find study partners or lack the time to attend tutoring sessions may discover that reviewing and studying with the chatGPT are helpful. Students' access to material and completion of assignments can be accelerated using this technology in research and education. More than one-third of university students who participated in a poll said that they used the ChatGPT for writing assessments. Professors have referred to these technologies as a ""threat"" and a ""plague on education,"" and ChatGPT has been prohibited from several educational institutions. Thus, this research focuses on the introduction of Features, Challenges, and Threads chatGPT in Higher Education. This study is conducted using the literature review method. According to this research result, this tool can boost student engagement by providing immersive, dynamic, and customized learning environments. However, there are some related issues that need to be considered such as integrity, accuracy and reliability, information bias, and privacy issues. We can therefore infer that there may be benefits as well as drawbacks to employing AI in education that need to be taken into account.

N2  - In today's fast-paced academic environment, efficient access to professional development resources is of paramount importance. This study investigates the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the LangChain framework to develop a question answering (QA) system using the Llama-2 large-language model. The QA system was designed to improve information retrieval accuracy and relevance for policy-related questions based on the handbook for the faculty and non-teaching staff development program at Iloilo Science and Technology University, Philippines. By leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the system processes natural language questions and retrieves relevant information from diverse data sources such as handbook and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in PDF format. The QLoRA technique was employed for model fine-tuning with 4-bit precision and the optimization of VRAM usage while retaining its high performance. The fine-tuned model indicated that the training process for question and answering reached the 105th global step, along with its training loss and other training metrics, including runtime, samples processed per second, steps processed per second, total floating-point operations, and epoch information. Thus, this study demonstrates that this approach enhances information accessibility and support efficiency within academic institutions, especially during times of crisis like pandemic. Future research could further enhance QA systems to augment question-answering systems by integrating personalized features, cutting-edge natural language processing techniques, affective computing techniques, machine learning strategies, and corresponding evaluation performance metrics.

N2  - In this research paper we examine undergraduate students' use of and perceptions of generative AI (GenAI). Although the initial hype around ChatGPT has subsided, GenAI applications continue to make inroads across learning activities. Like any other emerging technology, there is a lack of consensus around using GenAI within higher education. Students are early adopters of the technology, utilizing it in atypical ways and forming a range of perceptions and aspirations about it. To understand where and how students are using these tools and how they view them, we present findings from an open-ended survey response study with undergraduate students pursuing information technology degrees. Students were asked to describe 1) their understanding of GenAI; 2) their use of GenAI; 3) their opinions on the benefits, downsides, and ethical issues pertaining to its use in education; and 4) how they envision GenAI could ideally help them with their education. Thirty-seven students provided responses ranging in length from 20 to 300 words for each question. Responses were iteratively coded by researchers to uncover patterns in the data and then categorized thematically. Findings reveal that students' definitions of GenAI differed substantially and included many misconceptions - some highlight it as a technique, an application, or a tool, while others described it as a type of AI. There was a wide variation in the use of GenAI by students, with two common uses being writing and coding. They identified the ability of GenAI to summarize information and its potential to personalize learning as an advantage. Students identified two primary ethical concerns with using GenAI: plagiarism and dependency, which means that students do not learn independently. They also cautioned that responses from GenAI applications are often untrustworthy and need verification. Overall, they appreciated that they could do things quickly with GenAI but were cautious as using the technology was not necessarily in their best long-term as it interfered with the learning process. In terms of aspirations for GenAI, students expressed both practical advantages and idealistic and improbable visions. They said it could serve as a tutor or coach and allow them to understand the material better. We discuss the implications of the findings for student learning and instruction.

N2  - Prof Pi is a mathematics tutoring bot which allows students to use Whatsapp on their personal cell phones and communicate with GPT-4 (the artificial intelligence behind the chatGPT website) in order to receive help with mathematics. Prof Pi is configured or prompted to tutor students in mathematics and not to just simply provide answers to questions. Prof Pi has been deployed in a number of educational projects in Africa in different human languages. By analysing the conversational log data, this paper reports on different types of student users which can be seen using Prof Pi. Understanding these different types of users and their needs have informed future releases of Prof Pi.

N2  - Contributions: In this article, a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based Q&A system has been developed by integrating information retrieval and natural language processing techniques, using course materials as a knowledge base and facilitating real-time student interaction through a chat interface. Background: The rise of advanced AI exemplified by ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, has sparked interest in its application within higher education. AI has the potential to reshape education delivery through chatbots and related tools, improving remote learning and mitigating challenges, such as student isolation and educator administrative burdens. Yet, ChatGPTâ€™s practical applications in education remain uncertain, potentially due to its novel and enigmatic nature. Additionally, current e-learning chatbot systems often suffer from development complexity and a lack of input from key stakeholders, leading to developer-focused solutions rather than user-centered ones. Intended Outcomes: In this manuscript, we introduce a practical implementation of AI in education by creating a system called Q-Module-Bot that is accessible for both technical and nontechnical educators to harness e-learning benefits and demystify generative pretraining transformer (GPT). Application Design: The proposed Q-Module-Bot system has utilized pretrained large language models (LLMs) to build a Q&A system that helps students with their queries and supports education delivery using content extracted from a virtual learning environment (VLE). Findings: The prototype and system evaluation confirm the effectiveness of a scalable cross-departmental tool featuring source attribution and real-time responses. While successful in encouraging wider acceptance of GPT use cases in higher education, refinements are needed for full integration into the VLE and expansion to other modules/courses.

N2  - Recently, a noticeable trend of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) within the educational field has raised interest to study the shape and impact of this utilization. This study investigates the opinions of Information Technology (IT) undergraduate students about the utilization of GAI during the learning process, focusing on their perception of the quality of produced information, challenges and concerns while using it, how they utilize it during learning, and long-term impact of using GAI. An electronic survey was distributed as a Google from to undergraduate students from five IT programs at the University of Petra. The results of 122 students revealed that 82% use GAI while learning. The main use of GAI (80% of respondents) was for solving programming problems, while 66% of respondents use GAI to write reports and express their ideas. The majority (86%) of participants evaluate the presented information from GAI before using them, since they believe that sometimes the information is incorrect. 89% of respondents believe that they can learn from GAI tools, however, 95% of them feel it is necessary to train them on the proper utilization of GAI in education, and, 76% think that regulations must be released about the acceptable use of GAI.

N2  - Pedagogical agent is a software agent that provides guidance, feedback, or intervention to learners in digital environments. It has the potential to address issues in computer-based learning, particularly online learning, which often neglects affective aspects, such as the emotions of its users. Most systematic literature reviews (SLR) on pedagogical agent have focused on their visual design, types of feedback, and other empirical elements. However, what underlies these agentsâ€™ ability to provide interventions personalized to learnerâ€™s emotions has not been examined. So, this SLR explores how pedagogical agent has addressed learnerâ€™s emotional needs. The studyâ€™s research questions include: 1) To what extent does research exist on models, frameworks, or architectures for pedagogical agent, especially those related to emotions? 2) How are pedagogical agent represented, what types of interventions do they use, and how do they affect learnerâ€™s emotions? 3) What kinds of inputs are used to activate the pedagogical agentâ€™s functions? This SLR applied the Kitchenham method to select reference sources from 2013 to 2023 and was indexed by Scopus in the Q1 to Q4 range. Our review revealed the absence of a specific model for mapping out interventions tailored to the learnerâ€™s emotional needs. Most existing pedagogical agent provide learning interventions that are less adaptive and personalized based on the learnerâ€™s emotional state and are applied to asynchronous learning systems such as e-learning. There are still very few pedagogical agents that use real-time input technology by utilizing artificial intelligence to recognize learnerâ€™s emotion to trigger an adaptive and personalized intervention.

N2  - Crafting accurate and insightful narratives from data visualization is essential in data storytelling. Like creative writing, where one reads to write a story, data professionals must effectively â€œreadâ€ visualizations to create compelling data stories. In education, helping students develop these skills can be achieved through exercises that ask them to create narratives from data plots, demonstrating both â€œshowâ€ (describing the plot) and â€œtellâ€ (interpreting the plot). Providing formative feedback on these exercises is crucial but challenging in large-scale educational settings with limited resources. This study explores using GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM, to generate and evaluate narratives from data plots. The LLM was tested in zero-shot, one-shot, and two-shot scenarios, generating narratives and self-evaluating their depth. Human experts also assessed the LLM's outputs. Additionally, the study developed machine learning and LLM-based models to assess student-generated narratives using LLM-generated data. Human experts validated a subset of these machine assessments. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support scalable formative assessment in teaching data storytelling skills, which has important implications for AI-supported educational interventions.

N2  - This innovative practice paper explores two differing approaches to the use of artificial intelligence tools in computer science classrooms. Artificial Intelligence (AI), while not a new technology, has seen a rise in popularity over the past two years, with companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft making readily available generative AI tools for anyone to use. This surge in AI popularity has led to a rise in its use in educational settings, in some cases allowed and in others discouraged or disallowed. A debate has risen among academics, particularly in higher education, about what AI's place in education is, with some educators actively encouraging its use while others view the use of AI as a form of academic dishonesty. Given AI is only advancing and is becoming more prevalent, it will only continue to become a more dominant force throughout education and the world at large. This paper presents two educators' distinct viewpoints and experiences on how AI should be handled in computer science courses (absolutely forbidden vs. decriminalized). The goal of this paper is to present different perspectives as well as concrete experiences we have had with AI in our own classrooms to encourage others to consider their own positions on its use and its implications for their own learning environments. While the debate on the place of AI in education is a long way from being settled, educators need to think about making choices, clearly articulating policies, and evaluating the positives and negatives of positions about AI in their classrooms.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) stands as one of the game changers in a number of fields due to the growing potential that it comes with regarding advancing students in institutions of higher learning. This paper further explores the contribution of AI to increasing studentsâ€™ achievements within higher learning settings. Recognizing success in a student with multidimensional attributes, embracing a wide dimension from academic to social and emotional, this study explores how AI technologies might support the diverse dimensions of development and attainment for students. AI has a pathbreaking opportunity in overcoming these challenges through personalized, scalable, and adaptive interventions designed for individual specific needs of the students. These dimensions would form the core toward the deeper analysis of AI applications across varied life cycles of students. Chatbots and virtual mentors provide immediate help and guidance; they even help predict the course of a likely academic or emotional risk so that timely interventions could be given in such cases with sentiment analysis and tracking of behavior. It further assumes a very important role in building learning environments that can meet the varied learning style, preferences, and abilities of learners.

We compared the results to understand how each tool categorizes and describes individual reflections and multiple reflections as a whole. This study aims to explore ways to bridge the gaps between qualitative, quantitative, and computational analyses of reflective practices in teacher education. This study finds that to effectively integrate LLM analysis into teacher education, developing an analysis method and result format that are both comprehensive and relevant for preservice teachers and teacher educators is crucial.

N2  - There is growing evidence to suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be beneficial to people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), many of whom suffer from multiple comorbidities. People with ASD often do not respond well to CBT though. It is acknowledged that CBT requires adaptations to accommodate experienced socio-communication and neuropsychological impairments, but there is little evidence on how best to adapt CBT to optimise treatment outcomes for people with ASD. This paper proposes an affect-aware chatbot-based intervention in the form of an animated pedagogical as a means to inform the development of the effective and acceptable adaption of CBT to meet specific needs of autistic populations in the classroom.

N2  - This research full paper proposes an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to support the study of software project management, considering the students' learning styles. The learning process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that varies significantly from one person to another. Everyone absorbs knowledge differently because each has learning characteristics that directly impact the learning process. Ignoring these differences can result in inefficient and demotivating teaching. Therefore, teachers must invest time in understanding each student's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses, which can be overwhelming, especially in classrooms with a high student-teacher ratio. In this scenario, AI-based technology can be a strong ally. For example, chatbot technology offers an opportunity to adapt to these individual differences and to enable a more engaging and friendly approach for students, contributing to an active and interactive learning environment when exercising the role of a study companion and, why not, a bit of study guide. In this context, this paper proposes developing and applying a chatbot-based ITS called Juh to identify each student's learning style and, based on this understanding, present study activities appropriate to their learning style. The ITS uses meaningful learning theory to personalize the learning journey, detecting five profiles: active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative. This study chose project management (PM) as its knowledge area, particularly project management methodologies, aiming to evaluate the benefits of this research proposal. In this context, this research proposes to answer the following research question: RQ) How can the study of project management be supported actively and interactively, considering the students' learning styles? As its main contribution, the solution aims to offer support in the introduction to the study of project management and improve the learning experience according to the individual characteristics of each student, maximizing the assimilation of knowledge. Therefore, the difference lies in exploring how and what to learn. The solution was developed using the Design Science Research method and the low code Blip platform. After prototyping and evaluating the ITS with PM and education experts, promising points about the approach were observed, with users highlighting improvements in productivity and ease of use of the tutoring system.

N2  - Intent classification is a foundational element in natural language processing, enabling conversational systems to accurately interpret user intent. In educational contexts, effective intent classification within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) can significantly enhance personalized student interactions. This paper presents the intent classification module for the Learner-Aware AI (LAAI) tutor, a dialogue-based ITS designed to recognize and respond to diverse student behaviors, such as valid answers, questions, expressions of boredom, and requests for clarification. We introduce LAAIIntentD, a custom data set specifically designed for this task, containing 1,244 labeled training records and 278 evaluation records. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) LAAI-intent-classifier using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to create a lightweight yet powerful intent classifier. Our fine-tuned model achieves better overall Recall (0.86), Precision (0.85), and F1-Score (0.83) compared to GPT-based methods. GPT models with CoT and Few-Shot prompting improve Recall but sacrifice F1 scores. This highlights our model's efficiency in balancing accuracy and scalability for ITS applications.

N2  - This study explores and analyzes the specific performance of large language models (LLMs) in instructional design, aiming to unveil their potential strengths and possible weaknesses. Recently, the influence of LLMs has gradually increased in multiple fields, yet exploratory research on their application in education remains relatively scarce. In response to this situation, our research, grounded in pedagogical content knowledge theory, initially formulated an instructional design framework based on mathematical problem chains and corresponding prompt instructions. Subsequently, a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM's instructional design capabilities was developed. Utilizing Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, a high school mathematics teaching plan dataset was generated. Finally, the performance of LLMs in instructional design was evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that the teaching plans generated by LLMs excel in setting instructional objectives, identifying teaching priorities, organizing problem chains and teaching activities, articulating subject content, and selecting methods and strategies. Particularly commendable performance was noted in the modules of statistics and functions. However, there is room for improvement in aspects related to mathematical culture and interdisciplinary assessment, as well as in the geometry and algebra modules. Lastly, this study proposes initiatives, such as LLM prompt-based teacher training and the integration of mathematics-focused LLMs. These suggestions aim to advance personalized instructional design and professional development of teachers, offering educators new insights into the in-depth application of LLMs.

N2  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are fundamental to modern web development, yet many learners encounter significant challenges with its intricate syntax and extensive styling capabilities. Approximately 85.7% of students report difficulties in mastering CSS concepts, which are often compounded by motivational issues that hinder the learning process. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a web-based educational application designed to enhance CSS learning through the integration of an innovative pedagogical agent that employs advanced scaffolding methods. The application utilizes a dual-phase scaffolding approach, including procedural scaffolding, which offers structured guidance through pre-designed dialogues, and strategic scaffolding, which employs ChatGPT to deliver personalized, adaptive feedback tailored to individual learning needs. The implementation of these scaffolding techniques has led to significant improvements in both user engagement and learning outcomes. Thematic analysis revealed that 80% of participants found the learning style provided by the pedagogical agent aligned with their personal preferences, compared to only 40% with conventional methods. Additionally, 90% of participants experienced increased motivation using the application with the pedagogical agent, versus 40% with the conventional approach. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pedagogical agent in fostering a personalized and engaging learning experience, enhancing both motivation and learning. This research lays the chance for future advancements in interactive and adaptive learning systems, demonstrating the potential of combining pedagogical agents with sophisticated language models like ChatGPT to address educational and motivational challenges.

N2  - Enhancing interaction and feedback collection in a first-semester computer science course poses a significant challenge due to students' diverse needs and engagement levels. To address this issue, we created and integrated a command-based chatbot on the course communication server on Discord. The DiscordBot enables students to provide feedback on course activities through short surveys, such as exercises, quizzes, and lectures, facilitating stress-free communication with instructors. It also supports attendance tracking and introduces lectures before they start. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the DiscordBot as a communication tool. The ongoing feedback allowed course instructors to dynamically adjust and improve the difficulty level of upcoming activities and promote discussion in subsequent tutor sessions. The data collected reveal that students can accurately perceive the activities' difficulty and expected results, providing insights not possible through traditional end-of-semester surveys. Students reported that interaction with the DiscordBot was easy and expressed a desire to continue using it in future semesters. This responsive approach ensures the course meets the evolving needs of students, thereby enhancing their overall learning experience.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way programming is taught and learnt and is redefining t he way programming skills are assessed in the continuously changing field of computer science education. This paper introduces a novel approach for teaching and evaluating programming knowledge by reversing Bloom's taxonomy in order to accommodate AI-powered learning. Traditionally, Bloom's taxonomy progresses from basic cognitive skills like remembering and understanding to advanced skills like creating. With AI tools such as WebSim.ai and Anthropic Artifacts now capable of generating sophisticated outputs, the focus shifts away from students' ability to create, as these tools handle that task effectively. Instead, this paper proposes placing a higher emphasis on students' ability to understand and critically analyze AI -generated solutions, assessing their comprehension and ability to reverse-engineer existing work. We call this the Reverse Bloom Taxonomy, where students begin with creation and then move toward deeper understanding of the subject matter. This paper outlines the methodology for applying this reversed framework in programming education and presents a promising concept for improving student learning outcomes. The discussion addresses challenges in implementation and emphasizes the strategic integration of AI -driven learning to prepare students for a technology-driven workforce.

N2  - Enhancing student engagement and comprehension is crucial for effective learning. However, tracking and improving these dynamic states in real-time remains a significant challenge. This study addresses this gap by integrating real-time engagement prediction from gaze data with an adaptive learning system that utilizes ChatGPT-generated summaries to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Our experiment with twenty two (N=22) university students demonstrates the effectiveness of gaze data in predicting real-time engagement levels and the impact of adaptive interventions on student engagement, objective and subjective comprehension, and cognitive load. To predict the self-reported engagement and comprehension levels, two deep neural network models, InceptionTime and Transformers were employed. The Transformers model achieved better outcomes, with an average accuracy of 68.15% in predicting engagement levels across a 5-fold StratifiedGroupKFold cross-validation. The results revealed that the experimental group, which received the AI-driven interventions, exhibited significantly better learning outcomes, higher engagement, and better objective comprehension results compared to the control group. Additionally, we observed strong correlations between gaze metrics, engagement levels, and learning outcomes, suggesting that real-time adaptive interventions can dynamically enhance the educational experience. This study advances the field of educational technology by demonstrating the benefits of integrating gaze tracking and AI in learning environments, laying the foundation for dynamic learning interfaces that adapt to individual engagement levels, potentially improving both comprehension and involvement.

N2  - The influence of advanced technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), on the higher education sector is considerable and cannot be overlooked. It has been found out that this technology is beneficial both for tutors and students during the process of teaching and learning respectively. The primary issue that needs to be dealt with is the lack of personalized educational recommendations that would suit the specific needs, the modes of learning and the level of achievement of each particular learner. In most cases, academic institutions of a classical type offer standardized methods, which may, however, result to some students lagging behind or failing to cope with their study problems. The aimis to develop innovative systems for educational assistance based on AI technologies to solve particular issues like diversity in learning strategies and pace among learners and to ensure that a range of approaches are employed to elevate their learning experience. The system must adapt the teaching and the materials used, to the preferred way and rate of the student. In this particular research, a qualitative approach was adopted to engage in an extensive literature review of the broad field of educational psychology, adaptive learning systems, educational AI, and learning personalization. Examine the research and technological gaps which are the foundation of the proposed system. The results presented in this research show that it is necessary to improve the learning outcomes, the efficiency of resource usage and increase the level of engagement.

N2  - Conversational agents have been established to support educational practices, solving students' questions, recommending teaching materials, increasing the motivation of students who have little interest in certain content, among others. Although many studies are discussing the establishing of conversational agents, there is no global understanding of what has been investigated in this area. There are some previous secondary studies that have attempted to map the conversational agents used for educational purposes (i.e., pedagogical conversational agents). However, these studies are limited to include primary studies published in specific sets of conferences and journals. Therefore, an overview of the current state of the art associated with pedagogical conversational agents has not been produced yet. This research paper aims to contribute to the theme, through the presentation of planning, conduction, and results analysis of a systematic mapping on pedagogical conversational agents. We address the following questions: (i) in which areas have conversation agents been investigated?; (ii) at which education levels are conversational agents used?; (iii) which mechanisms do conversational agents use to interact with students?. We also present some discussions about research opportunities that can be explored in future works. This study aims to contribute to the topic of pedagogical conversational agents, helping researchers to have a deeper understanding of what has already been done and to guide their research to subjects not explored yet.

N2  - Brain signals analysis can be applied to students to identify their subject- or topic-specific struggles while they are listening to lecture videos. This re- search work proposes a threshold-based anomaly detection algorithm to identify the topics that cause students the most distress by analysing a dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wanghaohan/confused-eeg/data. Firstly, it identifies the index and timestamp of distress data points of studentsâ€™ brain signals, extracts the respective portion of transcribed textual content, given as prompt to ChatGPT or Bard via application programming interface (API) calls, get back the answers, and display it in a pop up window to the students. The proposed generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI)-powered intelligent tutoring system (ITS) captures almost 99% of confusion points and source confusion topic in brain signals as it uses context- aware algorithm thereby improving leanersâ€™ clarity on the source confusion topic after reading the pop-up window content generated by Gen AI.

N2  - This paper discusses how effective ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is likely to be compared to traditional corrective recasts in teaching English grammar to engineering undergraduates. With the rise of digital communication, a generation of learners for whom traditional methods seem to be less effective has emerged. This research contrasts the effects of ChatGPT's corrective feedback versus conventional teacher-led corrective recasts on grammatical proficiency among students, especially in subject-verb agreement and accuracy in tenses. 90 engineering students were divided into two groups á…³ one with the traditional approach to instruction and another using ChatGPT to practice grammar. Pre- and post-assessment tests were administered to the participants to measure improvements in grammar proficiency. Statistical analysis, using paired t-tests, indicated that both groups improved significantly, with the ChatGPT-assisted group showing more improvement in proficiency compared to the traditional approach. Another independent sample t-test confirmed that the AI-led feedback group had a significantly larger mean improvement in grammar proficiency compared to the traditional instruction group. The results of this study demonstrate that ChatGPT provides more effective corrective feedback to engineering students with varying levels of proficiency in subject-verb agreement and tenses usage, suggesting potential benefits for language education through integration with AI.

N2  - We have developed a chatbot that advises design students on their learning strategies through automatic interactions. We implemented a prototype of the chatbot in a sketchbook application that students utilized to receive advice during their design studies and evaluated whether it could help them to facilitate their learning strategies. The results demonstrated that, while the chatbot was generally able to create a natural dialogue flow with the students and helped to increase some learning strategies, there was still significant room for improvement. We analyzed the data on learning strategies and self-efficacy obtained from the experiments in detail and came up with a new hypothesis. That is, the experimental result indicated that chatbots can increase strategies for understanding learning progress, reflecting on learning, and devising learning methods by interacting with students in a way that gives them confidence, and we will empirically verify it in our future work.

N2  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) can be used to provide personalized assistance in Learning Management Systems (LMS). The main drawbacks to this end are that they are usually self-contained or system-dependent, and that integrations often lack in a representation of the considered learning content structure (i.e., are not structure-aware). The former prevents the reuse of devised didactic concept implementations. The latter can cause the user to get lost during the guidance process. Both are challenging to overcome because of the heterogeneous, LMS-specific approaches to structuring learning content. The aim of this thesis is to investigate frame conditions for reusing structure-aware ITS functionalities across LMS and to illustrate the gained insights in an elaborated ITS. Therefore, a system architecture is proposed that can retrieve the required learning process data from an LMS by employing a thin adaptation layer and transform this data into a generic data structure. This structure is used for providing assistance and for generating and integrating the learning content structure representation. The focus of this thesis is on the system-independent implementation of structure-aware intelligent assistance scenarios. The approach will be evaluated in terms of applicability and effectiveness considering different state-of-the-art LMS.

N2  - Access to education is a fundamental human right; however, girls and women in Afghanistan face numerous restrictions and barriers that the Taliban regime has imposed. Despite these issues, employing technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), provides convenient solutions to facilitate education and empower Afghan girls and women. In this paper, we explore how online educational platforms can assist in providing quality education to Afghan girls and women. It analyzes current digital delivery approaches with incorporated AI technology, including generative AI, Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), chatbots, and SMS-based learning platforms, that are accessible on low-cost devices and do not rely heavily on high-speed internet connections, and outlines suitable pathways to overcome the existing restrictions. By employing AI technology, a personalized learning environment can be created to deliver quality education based on the individual needs of Afghan girls and women. A survey is conducted to explore the feasibility of implementing an online educational platform in Afghanistan, considering challenges such as internet connectivity, availability of electricity, access to digital devices, and time constraints. Based on successfully implemented programs in another region, we listed recommendations for the policymakers, None governmental organizations (NGOs), and stakeholders to introduce customized Online educational platforms for Afghan girls and women.

N2  - Undergraduate students frequently encounter academic stress, highlighting the need for accessible and effective coping mechanisms. This study develops an AI chatbot grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles to meet the mental health needs of these students. The primary goal is to devise and assess a chatbot that delivers personalized support for managing academic stress. The chatbot engages students in meaningful conversations, identifies cognitive distortions in their thought processes, and provides customized coping strategies. It leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 turbo LLM for generating lifelike interactions and uses a vector database to store domain-specific knowledge. Responses are preprocessed with OpenAI embeddings for intent classification. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multinomial Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models are used for classifying cognitive distortions, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy of $85.94 \%$. Intent classification is refined using cosine similarity, enhancing the chatbotâ€™s conversational accuracy. Although SVM outperforms other models, ongoing challenges call for further research to refine the chatbotâ€™s functionality and improve its impact on student well-being.

N2  - The recent launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI has created a profound global impact, initiating deep questions among educators about how it might affect education, syllabi and teaching methods. Currently, the full scope of potential benefits and risks associated with ChatGPT in education remains unclear, given that its impact surpasses the level of preparation educators and institutions may have had for such a pre-trained generative AI tool. While Artificial Intelligence in Education has long been a subject of research, with a particular focus on developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems, the emergence of ChatGPT marks a distinctive advancement in this field. Unlike dedicated Intelligent Tutoring Systems, ChatGPT is readily available to a diverse spectrum of educational stakeholders, including teachers, students, schools, universities, and educational institutions. Scholars have initiated assessments of ChatGPT's effectiveness across various educational disciplines, even though ChatGPT was not explicitly designed for educational purposes. However, the widespread accessibility of ChatGPT, coupled with its extensive knowledge base, necessitates the development of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. In this paper, we introduce a holistic evaluation framework tailored for ChatGPT. This framework takes into account both soft and hard skills, and it is designed to seamlessly incorporate ChatGPT into Intelligent Tutoring Systems, making it suitable for a wide range of educational fields. By establishing a connection between ITS and ChatGPT, as they are both AI tools, we can benefit from the substantial background work achieved by previous research in ITSs to evaluate the educational influence of ChatGPT.

N2  - In many post-Colonial African countries, English is the medium of instruction at schools and universities. Many, if not most of the students, however, are not home language English speakers. In the specific situation of Zimbabwe, approximately eighty percent of the population is Shona speaking and approximately ten percent of the population is Ndebele speaking. Existing research shows that when learners or students are forced to learn technical subjects (such as mathematics and computer programming) in their non-home language, they are doing double work. Not only do they need to learn the new subject domain, they also need to translate these new terms to and from their home language. This paper investigates the use of an GPT-4 based artificially intelligent tutoring bot configured to tutor the subject of Python Programming in both Shona and Ndebele. This paper is the first step of a multi-step research project which has the final goal of helping Zimbabwean learners and students learn Python Programming in their home language. This first step, however, reports on language evaluations of the GPT-4 based tutoring bot operating in Shona and Ndebele.

N2  - How do students use artificial intelligence tools in coursework projects when given the liberty to do so, with the only requirement of documenting how, where and why? We describe experiences with two groups of undergraduates in courses related to serious game authoring and human-computer interaction, both carried out in the second semester of 2023. In the serious games course, students were given the option of following a teacher-developed methodology for generating graphical assets for their serious games using a set of generative AI tools. This methodology was explained in the class but not hands on lab was carried out. In the interaction course, students were free to choose which AI tools to use when designing their system or in the development of their project documentation. Despite the limited number of participants (41 in total) we can see very different views and degrees of involvement: while some tried to use AI for as many tasks as possible, others considered that the learning curve for those tools was too steep to be worthwhile. Both experiences included a free-text survey at the end, and taken together, provide insights into how both supervised and unsupervised generative AI use could impact undergraduate projects in similar subjects. In addition to describing how students chose to use the tools, and the main takeaways from their survey response, we also discuss some of the ethical aspects about the access to the tools and what should be the minimal conditions to be met to allow the equitable use of AI in the classroom.

N2  - This study analyzes how ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence tool, reproduces gender stereotypes when creating educational case studies. Through a qualitative analysis of 50 cases, variables such as gender, character role, educational level, position held, and socioeconomic level were examined. The results show that women are more frequently represented in problematic roles, with lower levels of education and in low-ranking positions, while men predominate in problem-solving roles, with postgraduate studies and in leadership positions. These findings underscore the risk of AI perpetuating gender biases present in the data with which it was trained. The study highlights the importance of a critical and conscious use of AI in education to avoid the reproduction of inequalities and promote a more equitable representation of gender in the content generated.

N2  - The purpose of this research is to investigate how artificial intelligence (AI) affects students' academic experiences in terms of their study habits, academic achievement, social interactions, and emotional growth. While AI offers advantages such as increased accessibility to learning resources and personalized experiences, it also presents challenges. Through a questionnaire-based survey targeting teachers/Faculty members, this research aims to explore how AI influences learning behaviors and outcomes. This research will advance knowledge about artificial intelligence in education. This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly learning platforms like ChatGPT, on students' academic experiences, focusing on study habits, academic achievement, social interactions, and emotional growth. By surveying 54 faculty members through a combination of multiple-choice and open-ended questions, the research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the influence of AI in education. The findings reveal a dual-sided impact. While AI enhances academic performance through personalized learning and improved accessibility, it poses significant challenges. Overreliance on AI tools appears to hinder critical facets of student development, including study habits, emotional well-being, social interactions, and critical thinking. The convenience of AI risks fostering passive learning behaviors, reducing interpersonal communication, and promoting emotional and social detachment. This research underscores the need for a balanced approach to AI integration in education. To maximize benefits and mitigate drawbacks, educators and institutions must combine AI's potential with active teacher involvement, emphasizing critical thinking and social engagement. By treating AI as a supportive tool rather than a substitute for human educators, the long-term development of students can remain both positive and holistic.

N2  - Learning performance data, such as correct or incorrect answers and problem-solving attempts in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), facilitate the assessment of knowledge mastery and the delivery of effective instructions. However, these data tend to be highly sparse (80%$\sim$90% missing observations) in most real-world applications. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict learners' future performance and explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learning performance data to address data sparsity. First, learning performance data can be represented as a 3-D tensor with dimensions corresponding to learners, questions, and attempts, effectively capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing (KT) tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, data augmentation using generative artificial intelligence models, including generative adversarial network (GAN), specifically vanilla GANs and generative pretrained transformers (GPTs, specifically GPT-4o), generate data tailored to individual clusters of learning performance. We tested this systemic framework on adult literacy datasets from AutoTutor lessons developed for adult reading comprehension. We found that tensor factorization outperformed baseline KT techniques in tracing and predicting learning performance, demonstrating higher fidelity in data imputation, and the vanilla GAN-based augmentation demonstrated greater overall stability across varying sample sizes, whereas GPT-4o-based augmentation exhibited higher variability, with occasional cases showing closer fidelity to the original data distribution. This framework facilitates the effective augmentation of learning performance data, enabling controlled, cost-effective approach for the evaluation and optimization of ITS instructional designs in both online and offline environments prior to deployment, and supporting advanced educational data mining and learning analytics.

N2  - Nowadays, information technology is applied for teaching and learning in high-school. It is an essential trend for the modern education, especially building intelligent systems to support the learning of mathematics. In the math subjects of Vietnamese high-school, problems about surveying properties of a function are popular in high-school exams. There are some current tools can solve them automatically. However, they only can display the graph of a function; they cannot solve problems about determining the value of a parameter to satisfy some conditions about this function's properties. In this paper, we will present a method to design an intelligent chatbot for solving problems in this knowledge domain. It plays as an instructor to give some tips and tutor the learner how to solve problems automatically. This program can communicate with the learner through the question-answering process by chatbot. This tutoring of our system simulates the tutoring method of the teacher to the students in practice.

N2  - This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of advanced large language models (LLMs) including GPT, BART, BERT, and T5, fine-tuned using a specialized FAQ dataset from ESTIN, a higher education institution. The study aims to assess the performance of these LLM models in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses to common queries. These models were evaluated using key metrics such as evaluation loss (eval loss) and ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2), which measure the alignment between the generated responses and the reference answers. The experiment results show that BERT outperforms the other models, achieving a lowest eval loss and highest ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, making it the most effective model in this context. The findings underscore the potential of BERT in educational AI applications. Finally, some future research directions are discussed, including the integration of additional models and the enhancement of the FAQ dataset to further improve performance.

N2  - In this Innovative Practice full paper, we introduce Gurukul, an innovative coding platform designed to support teaching Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) course by integrating advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have emerged as powerful tools in Computer Science Education (CSEd), offering unparalleled opportunities for enhancing student comprehension and engagement. However, their use in educational settings presents challenges, including tendencies toward hallucination, contextual inaccuracies, and the risk of undermining critical thinking by providing explicit solutions. To address these challenges, and to explore how specialized LLMs can bolster learner engagement, we present Gurukul, a platform featuring dual innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Guardrails. Gurukul offers a hands-on practice feature where students can solve DSA problems within a code editor, supported by a dynamically Guardrailed LLM that prevents the delivery of explicit solutions. Additionally, the platform's study feature utilizes RAG, drawing from OpenDSA as a trusted source, to ensure accurate and contextually relevant information is provided. To assess the platform's effectiveness, we conducted a User Study with students, and a User Expert Review with faculty from a U.S. public state university specializing in DSA courses. Our analysis of student usage patterns and perceptions, along with insights from instructors, reveal that Gurukul positively impacted student engagement and learning in DSA, demonstrating the potential of specialized LLMs to enhance educational outcomes in this field.

N2  - In recent years, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in tasks such as natural language understanding, code generation, and even passing professional exams. Trained on vast datasets, these models have shown high accuracy across various fields. One challenging area for LLMs is professional certification exams, which require specialized knowledge and understanding of complex regulations. The Real Estate Transaction Specialist Examination (RETSE) in Japan is a key certification for professionals managing real estate transactions. Passing the RETSE qualifies individuals to handle legal responsibilities like ensuring the legality of property deals. The exam covers civil law, tax law, and real estate regulations, making it a comprehensive test of legal knowledge. With a pass rate of around 15%, it is considered one of Japan's more difficult professional exams, making it a strong benchmark for evaluating LLM performance. This study evaluates the ability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to answer RETSE questions, comparing their performance to official passing criteria and analyzing the effect of prompt engineering. While GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, neither model met the passing standard. Prompt strategies such as â€œConsider customary lawsâ€ improved response accuracy, especially for complex legal questions. These findings suggest that while GPT models cannot fully replace human expertise in legal exams like RETSE, they offer potential as supplementary learning tools for verifying basic knowledge. To mitigate the risk of job displacement by AI, it is crucial for professionals to enhance their expertise in areas where LLMs struggle, such as recent legal changes and ethical judgment. This study highlights both the limitations and potential of GPT in legal contexts, providing insights into how AI can support learners and practitioners in real estate law.

N2  - This study utilized the Korean College Scholastic Ability Test questions to evaluate the mathematical problem-solving abilities of the latest Generative AI models, o1-preview and gpt-4o. The performance of the AI models was analyzed using 92 questions from the mathematics sections of the 2023 and 2024 tests and compared with the performance of human learners. The results showed that the o1-preview model achieved an average accuracy rate of 81.52%, performing at a level comparable to top-tier human learners. The gpt-4o model demonstrated mid to lower-tier performance with an average accuracy rate of 49.46%. When analyzing different problem types, this study found that both models did better on multiple-choice questions, but their accuracy decreased as the problems got harder. AI uses reasoning processes similar to those of humans when solving mathematical problems. This study is significant because it offers new insights into AIâ€™s mathematical abilities and shows the potential for using AI in education.

N2  - The adoption of innovative technologies is critical for improving teaching practices and student learning outcomes. Among these, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative tool capable of reshaping traditional educational paradigms. ChatGPT, a sophisticated language model developed by OpenAI, offers numerous opportunities for educators to enhance pedagogical effectiveness and streamline lesson preparation processes. This study explores the efficacy of ChatGPT in lesson preparation by surveying and interviewing teachers at Dr. Josefa Jara Martinez High School in the Philippines. It aims to understand their attitudes towards and experiences with integrating ChatGPT into their teaching practices. Despite the promising potential of AI in education, the adoption of such technologies in the Philippines faces significant barriers, including limited awareness, access issues, and concerns about technology integration. The findings reveal that while teachers recognize the benefits of using ChatGPT, such as improved efficiency and personalized instruction, challenges like lack of training and ethical concerns remain prevalent. The study underscores the need for comprehensive professional development programs and robust ethical guidelines to support the effective and responsible use of AI tools in education. The results show that teachers have a wide range of opinions, but many of them agree that ChatGPT has the potential to make lesson planning easier, offer individualized learning resources, and keep students interested in class. On the other hand, issues with consistency with curriculum requirements, dependability, and general efficacy were also apparent. The study sheds light on the challenges associated with integrating AI into education and makes recommendations for professional development, focused assistance, and ethical considerations to help high schools adopt AI technologies responsibly. Teachers can optimize learning experiences, improve teaching effectiveness, and give students the tools they need to succeed in the digital age by tackling these issues and utilizing AI's transformative potential.

N2  - Multidisciplinary education requires support from technology to address the needs of diverse learners on multiple subjects. Exploratory research on pedagogies for digital education was conducted to aggregate learning theories suitable for multidisciplinary education. The theories were synthesized to define four pillars of digital pedagogy. These four pillars were used to build intelligent tutoring model for moral philosophy education. The model is a pluri-disciplinary investigation into the fields of philosophy and computing. The Intelligent Moral Tutoring System (ITMS) is run by three agents called learner recommendation agent, scaffolding support agent and biological diagnostic agent. These agents use the moral repository, which stores content, referenced metaethics and learning statement. Learner agent uses learner profile for intelligent recommendations. The scaffolding agent improves the investigation process by constantly evaluating the learning statement through its elements and sharing passive reflective guidance for further study. The concept of learning statement defined by the learner for his/her learning journey is introduced to explain the scaffolding agent. Neuro technology enhancements are suggested by the biological agent, for enhancing moral judgement and overcoming biological deficiencies.

N2  - Academic integrity is essential in educational institutes to ensure equal and fair learning. However, the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education has generated concerns about its integrity. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to complete assignments, projects, and evaluations has raised concerns about unfair benefits and the legitimacy of the work being submitted. This study highlights the need for rules and systems to protect academic integrity as AI expands in education. This study attempts to evaluate AI-generated solutions at high school, college, and graduate levels based on three important metrics: Fulfillment, Presentation, and Helpfulness. This study implements an experiment using the proposed framework, and the findings show that the used generative AI models exceeds human-like behavior. Through this study, it was observed that there is a risk of bias against those with real efforts.

Our approach leverages a combination of vanilla sequence-to-sequence modeling, fine tuning LLaMA-2, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The methodology involves extensive data collection through web scraping, synthetic question generation, and a comprehensive look at information retrieval strategies, including the implementation of a question-topic classification system. Comparative analysis of the three approaches shows that finetuning and RAG have competitive performance, with RAG providing the most accurate and contextually relevant results, and finetuning having the superior dialog coherence. Through these results, BrockportGPT offers a model for developing an institutional chatbot, highlighting the potential for AI-driven education tools to improve information accessibility and dissemination processes.

The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.160$ , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( $\beta = 0.140$ , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.670$ , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( $\beta = 0.330$ , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( $\beta = 0.760$ , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness. However, social interaction support and perceived enjoyment did not demonstrate significant influence. These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that emphasise usability and provide robust educational and emotional support to enhance acceptance. The study contributes to theory by extending TAM with constructs from SST, offering new insights into AI adoption in academic contexts. Practically, the results guide policymakers and developers in fostering AI acceptance by addressing educational and emotional needs, ensuring effective implementation in higher education.

N2  - Personalized approaches and tailored support have become increasingly significant in the field of online education, aiming to enhance the overall learning experiences of learners. This paper introduces a novel approach for addressing challenges in providing tailored support by utilizing chatbot technology and the flexibility of fuzzy logic. The chatbot is responsible for delivering precise and tailored responses to learners, considering their input, typically in text form. This is accomplished through the utilization of a rule-based system that is capable of generating accurate answers according to predefined criteria. To augment this support, fuzzy logic is employed for modeling the learners' knowledge, thereby enhancing the chatbot's proficiency in accurately evaluating and responding to inquiries. Consequently, the provision of assistance can be tailored to the specific knowledge level of learners, aiding them in achieving their educational goals. This methodology is incorporated in an intelligent tutoring system designed to provide tutoring for the programming language Java. The evaluation findings demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in delivering personalized assistance through a chatbot. The results indicated that the chatbot's responses were highly rated in terms of clarity, relevance, and usefulness. Additionally, the system was found to effectively address learners' needs with quality and adequacy.

N2  - The main goal of this paper is to propose a framework to better understand and capitalize on the many implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for education, especially but not limited to the most recent developments of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Four complementary categories are identified, each presenting diverse opportunities and challenges:1)Leveraging AI to improve instruction: This involves using AI to create new and more powerful learning opportunities for learners â€“ at all levels of schools and across subject areas as well as instructional contexts.2)Promoting AI Literacy: This involves helping everyone develop sufficient understanding of AI to function in a society where AI is increasingly used.3)Rethinking workforce preparation: This involves responding to the need to change how we prepare future workers, once uses of AI take over functions previously performed by humans in specific occupations.4)Leveraging AI to support educatorsâ€™ own work: While the focus of the previous three categories is on student learning, here the focus shifts on educatorsâ€™ using AI in their work to increase their productivity and well-being.In what follows, I will examine each of these areas using conceptual analysis, building on findings from relevant research studies I have been involved in, as well as recent conversations within an interdisciplinary group of faculty, staff and students as part of an internal planning grant for the University of Rochester. For each area, after a brief introduction I will identify and discuss a few key elements; selected illustrations, in most cases reporting findings from relevant research projects, will also be provided in separate â€œboxesâ€ so they can be read independently.For further information about this paper please contact the author.

N2  - Different artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies and systems are gaining in a variety of uses, including personal assistants, chatbots, different suggestion engines, smart appliances etc. Usage of this technology is accompanied by various positive views, but also by a fair share of skepticism. Since ChatGPT has been introduced, there have been rising debates regarding AI and its effects on education, employment, ethics, security, and other areas. One of the important questions is how young people view this new technology and all its implications. The purpose of this study was to learn more about how high school students view and feel about AI. Research regarding AI was conducted among 124 high school students in classes I through IV (aged 15 to 19). Although new technologies are something they embrace, students also find that no AI technology can completely replace human beings in education. Despite having different viewpoints on the matter, they are optimistic about new technologies and think that AI tools would be beneficial for future teaching and learning.

N2  - The recent advancements in Generative AI have been highlighted by the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. We track this evolution from the initial recurrent neural networks to the development of architectures like Transformers and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). ChatGPT, with its impressive ability to comprehend, process, and produce natural language, has piqued the interest of educators, students, and institutions within the education sector through its creation of high-quality textual responses.This marks the beginning of a new era in educational possibilities: we emphasize the beneficial effects of ChatGPT in learning environments, noting its utility in programming assistance, its clarity in concept explanation, and its role in enhancing automated learning processes. We also recognize potential drawbacks, including the risks of over-reliance, plagiarism, and the inherent constraints of these models in tackling mathematical and linguistic problem-solving tasks.In exploring the Paradox of Automation, we examine the implications of an over-reliance on AI in education. We seek to understand the importance of preserving critical thinking skills and ensuring that technology serves as a tool for augmenting human capabilities rather than supplanting them. Our analysis acknowledges that, while AI, including ChatGPT, can assist in content generation and problem-solving, it is essential for students to cultivate their abilities in analytical thinking, content verification, and error correction.

N2  - The widespread use of digital systems and tools in education has opened up opportunities for collecting, measuring, and analysing data about user (learner, teacher) interactions with a variety of learning resources and activities, with the ultimate objective of better understanding learning and advancing both learning outcomes and the overall learning experience. This promise motivated the development of Learning Analytics (LA) as a research and practical field and the use of insights derived from learning trace data for evidence-based decision making in a variety of educational settings. While LA has made a significant contribution to better understanding of learning and the environments in which it takes place, many open questions and challenges remain. Furthermore, new opportunities and challenges continue to emerge with the ever-changing modalities of teaching and learning, the latest of which are associated with the rapid development and accessibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Taking the cyclical model of LA as its exploration framework, this paper examines how key components of the LA model â€“ namely data, methods, and actions â€“ relate to and may benefit from the latest developments in AI, and especially Generative AI. Aiming for evidence-based analysis and discussion of the interplay between LA and AI, the paper relies on the latest empirical research in LA and the related research fields of AI in Education and Educational Data Mining.

N2  - This research full paper describes a web-based online learning platform that delivers financial literacy lessons via talking head videos of AI-generated personas with two additional core features: LLM-powered proactive chat-based question-and-answer interactivity, and personal choice of the AI instructor from a list of distinct personas. We conducted two comparative studies with a total of 233 Thai students aged 1825, which aim to 1) investigate the impact of interactivity and instructor selection on the learning experience, and 2) further explore the underlying factors at play with instructor selection by introducing AI instructors' backstories as an extra intervention. We found that enabling interactivity significantly enhanced learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and virtual instructors' humanness compared to the passive setting. Providing learners with a choice of AI instructors provided minimal additional benefit. However, the learner's feeling of relatedness toward the instructor is a significant positive predictor of learning motivation, positive emotion, and agent credibility, while goal alignment with the agent correlates with perceived learning facilitation, and admiration corresponds with perceived agent humanness. These findings underscore the potential of interactive virtual instructors-ones that interactively encourage learners to reflect on the teaching materials throughout the lesson through two-way interaction-in enhancing motivational and experiential aspects of remote education, even if they do not significantly impact comprehension, and the importance of promoting learner's relatedness and goal alignment with the agent in boosting other aspects of the learning experience.

N2  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging technologies of today. It provides applications in addition to the traditional computing environments, and is also in affordable smart devices, making AI available everywhere. These affordable devices have built-in capabilities to handle complex computing tasks (edge computing), flexible access to fast network resources, access to cloud-based services to solve complex problems on a collaborative basis, and access to an enormous amount of open and closed data resources. In education, AI contributes in at least two ways: (1) the scope and content of education - what kind of education is needed; and (2) the process of education - support and changes to education and the teacher's work. In the scope of education, we must consider that AI (and related technologies) will replace some jobs (education will no longer be needed), some jobs will change dramatically (education content must be modified), and a lot of new jobs will be generated (new education must be established). In the process of education - the work itself - AI will have and has the role of reformer and enabler, which also changes the characteristics and division of duties. In this paper we analyze the opportunities and challenges caused by AI in education. Although the focus is on the role of AI, it is difficult to separate it from other technology-driven changes, especially in the discussion about work life.

N2  - Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational analytics introduces promising and innovative approaches, particularly in predicting student dropout rates. One of these new approaches addresses the challenges of predicting student dropout rates. This study investigates the integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including OpenAI LLMs, HuggingFace embeddings, and FAISS vector databases, within a Few-Shot Learning framework. This study aims to identify subtle indicators of potential dropout risks by utilizing LLMâ€™s contextual understanding and flexibility. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques were employed to improve the quality of contextual data provided to these models. Through extensive experiments with real-world data, we demonstrate that LLMs outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in predictive accuracy and provide valuable textual analyses of student data. This research highlights the potential of LLMs as powerful tools for dropout prediction in academic settings, contributing to ongoing efforts to reduce dropout rates.

N2  - A futuristic Technology Enhanced Learning concept, a conversational Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for deployment in an e-learning context, is gradually becoming a reality thanks to the continuous advancement in Artificial Intelligence and to the worldwide increasing demand for online learning, especially during the pandemic. However, we do need to consider whether such technology will support student learning or make learning more difficult. In the absence of a mature conversational Intelligent Tutoring System, this article aims to address this question indirectly through an investigation of how students and tutors in an online learning programme perceive the concept of conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems, such as a chatbot, for online learning. This is achieved by surveying students who are currently enrolled in an online programme and interviewing the tutors on the same programme. The research concludes that ITS would very likely enhance online learning experience for both students and tutors, but there are various concerns that must be addressed.

N2  - The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have transformed software testing, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as powerful tools for automating test case generation. This paper explores Quality Assurance (QA) for LLM-generated test cases in black-box testing through a systematic literature review. Though LLMs are increasingly used for test case generation, challenges in ensuring their quality remain. Following PRISMA guidelines, relevant studies were selected from databases focusing on critical quality attributes, QA frameworks, metrics, and challenges. LLMs demonstrate high efficiency but face numerous issues. A recommendation for future research is given on addressing standardized metrics and improving human-AI collaboration for enhanced testing outcomes.

N2  - Blended learning has gained popularity for its flexibility and technological integration. However, many current models simply replicate offline classrooms in virtual environments, lacking engagement for younger students. While gamified education fosters student motivation, it fails to enhance deep knowledge comprehension or assist in automating assessment processes. This paper introduces a novel educational approach, Education From Short Video (EFSV), which uniquely advocates for â€˜Short-Video-Izingâ€™ educational content and automating student assessments. We propose a model that transforms content into interactive short videos by blending AI-driven and manual techniques, moving away from traditional definition-based methods. Additionally, a Short Video Platform of Education (SVPE) is developed, where students act as both content creators and viewers. On this platform, student interactions like â€˜commentsâ€™ and â€˜likesâ€™ automate final grading, significantly reducing the workload of teachers. Experimental results demonstrate that this model enhances studentsâ€™ learning effectiveness and enjoyment.

N2  - In this era, people often overeat, make parties or events, where there are excessive availability of food. As well as shops or restaurants that sell food, has ready-to-eat foods that only lasts one day and then treated as expired food. Often this precious food is thrown in the trash, and meanwhile, many destitute people cannot eat enough per day. Therefore, this research paper aims to mobilize people who overeat and donate their excess food that can still be consumed to those in need. This smartphone application is equipped with activities such as registering for new donors who want to join the mobile application and logging in for donors who are already registered in the mobile application. Donors can monitor couriers taking photos of recipients with food donated from donors. In addition, donors can select the food category for donation and input amount, track the donated food that the courier has picked up, and send it to the recipient. This mobile application is also equipped with donors to share experiences, ideas, and views based on topics created by staff and available threads.

N2  - Studies have shown that many students worldwide rely on the internet to study. But the problem arises as most of the sites that provide services to students are limited to some extent or the services are not freely accessible. Therefore, developing an application to combat these issues while minimizing human error and guaranteeing data security is essential. The proposed student learning system has been created to make studying easier with the help of AI powered tools. The AI-powered Student Learning System (AISLS) is designed as an innovative and standalone application aimed at transforming the educational experience for students by integrating with the university Moodle website. Functioning independently, the AI-powered Student Learning System will be accessible through web browsers to provide users with a seamless and intuitive interface for a flexible learning experience. The system assists students to generate study content such as flashcards, summaries, analyze past papers easily with the help of AI-powered technology. Additionally, chatbot assistance, past paper analyzer and external resource curator, it aids in the efficient and effective studying for students with web-based technology. This paper comprehends an attempt to create a web-application to support students to make learning easier by using AI techniques. Finally, a survey was conducted to collect data regarding the quality of the outputs and the user experience.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a crucial tool across diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education [1], [2]. In education, AI often conjures images of innovative products from leading brands. However, there are significant drawbacks to relying on paid or free AI services with user interfaces. These include prohibitive costs, accessibility issues due to unstable internet connections, and data privacy concerns. Moreover, the one-size-fits-all approach of many AI services fails to meet the diverse needs of educational environments, compromising flexibility and customization. Dependence on external service providers for updates and consistent operation introduces risks of educational interruptions. To address these limitations and explore AI's potential in foreign language teaching, this research investigates the development of a local AI system. Such systems offer increased control, customization tailored to individual or institutional needs, and heightened privacy, suggesting a shift toward more autonomous and tailored educational technology solutions. This study aims to compare the results of a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI model with those of the paid service, ChatGPT, in identifying gender-specific profession names in schoolbooks. This comparison serves as a test to evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of each model for this specific task. The efficiency of the AI models will be examined by analyzing the relationship between gender and professions within a sample database created using five randomly selected German language textbooks used in Turkish schools. The purpose is to demonstrate the potential of a locally installed AI system for creating databases for foreign language teaching, overcoming the limitations of relying on external AI services, and providing a more customizable, efficient, and privacy-conscious solution for language learning. This study is supported by the Scientific Research Coordination Unit of Anadolu University under project number SBA-2024-2457.

N2  - Multi-atlas segmentation is commonly performed in two separate steps: i) multiple pairwise registrations, and ii) fusion of the deformed segmentation masks towards labeling objects of interest. In this paper we propose an approach for integrated volume segmentation through multi-atlas registration. To tackle this problem, we opt for a graphical model where registration and segmentation nodes are coupled. The aim is to recover simultaneously all atlas deformations along with selection masks quantifying the participation of each atlas per segmentation voxel. The above is modeled using a pairwise graphical model where deformation and segmentation variables are modeled explicitly. A sequential optimization relaxation is proposed for efficient inference. Promising performance is reported on the IBSR dataset when comparing to majority voting and local appearance-based weighted voting.

N2  - The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education promises transformative changes, but its effective adoption relies on the establishment of trust. Drawing from various scientific articles, this study identified seven design principles that influence students' trust towards AI-powered teaching tools. These principles are ""Privacy"", ""Intelligence,"" ""Fairness"", ""Controllability"", ""Engagement"", ""Transparency"", and ""Friendliness"". A quantitative survey, involving students from the Hague University of Applied Sciences, was employed to rank these principles based on their perceived importance. The results revealed students find all principles important except for ""Friendliness"". Gender-based analysis indicated females' pronounced emphasis on ""Fairness"", ""Friendliness"" and ""Engagement"" compared to males. Further analysis revealed students in ICT related fields value ""Privacy"" significantly more than their non-ICT related counterparts and ""Fairness"" significantly less.

N2  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has shown promising potential to enhance learning experiences and provide personalized assistance to students. However, existing AI-based educational tools often exhibit limitations, including inconsistent feedback, limited adaptability to diverse learning needs, and difficulties in delivering real-time and accurate assessments. These limitations restrict the full effectiveness of AI in supporting studentsâ€™ educational journeys. In this paper, we present the development of an AI-based Python programming education system that integrates a Chatbot for student assistance, an automated grading system for feedback, and an entrance exam feature that suggests chapters and sections for review. The Chatbot and grading system employs GPT-3.5 Turbo, leveraging its extensive knowledge base, cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, and adaptability to various programming queries, which enhances student engagement. Although the system underwent interactive testing and continuous improvements, the development process encountered difficulties in maintaining consistent AI feedback and enhancing real-time performance. Users can take quizzes, receive grades, obtain personalized feedback, and get course recommendations. The grading system achieved 28/30 consistency with its output while the course recommendation system achieved $26 / 30$ consistency with its outputs. The results indicate that while the AI-based system aids in learning programming by providing instant feedback and recommendations for improvement, its effectiveness is limited. This project underscores the potential of AI to enhance educational tools and sets the stage for further advancements in AI-driven education systems.

N2  - Personalized learning refers to a system of teaching and learning where the content, methods, and assessment are tailored to each learner's needs, capacities/skills/competencies, and pace. There is abundant literature about personalized learning, describing its advantages, challenges, and approaches to implementing it. This study has explored the abundant literature and realized that while there are substantial proposed ways to achieve personalized learning, these proposals are not implemented into actionable products. This research aims to construct a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tutor that implements personalized learning and teaching in a higher education level course. The research methodology involved exploring literature to determine the requirements for personalized learning and designing a tutor system. The resultant system uses Custom GPT technology, Application Programming Interface (API), a repository for storing content, learners' profile information, and performance metrics. Out of the six components that make the proposed system, only the â€œCustom GPTâ€ component has been implemented and tested on a course named â€œApplied Cryptographyâ€ in a postgraduate program. Though the preliminary results are promising, an effective assessment of the system will be made when the full implementation is completed. Further, issues related to ethics, scaling and integration with learning management systems should also be considered. Subsequent work to this study will focus on those issues.

N2  - Applications for traditional musical instruments from Sri Lanka have not received enough attention, even with the progress in machine learning. This paper presents a novel method for categorizing and transcribing notations for the flute and gataberaya which is an indigenous drum from Sri Lanka using deep learning methods. Based on a manually recorded audio recording dataset with 168 flute recordings and 81 gataberaya recordings with varying lengths and single-noted, 1D Convolutional Neural Networks were used to construct a classification model. The system also generates musical notations from audio recordings using an algorithm and converts Western musical notation to Sinhala musical notations using a prompt with a Large Language Model API call. The methodology includes data augmentation for raw data and feature extraction with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, and frequency analysis using the Fast Fourier Transform. The classification model achieved 88.71% training accuracy and 91.16% validation accuracy, successfully identifying instrument types, and the notation generation for the flute shows effectiveness by correctly recognizing the notes and the relative octave of the frequency. However, challenges remain for unpitched instruments like the Gataberaya due to the limited dataset. This approach acts as a valuable tool for the preservation of Sri Lankan traditional music.

N2  - In this paper, we present an interactive system partly based on voice output in an augmented reality environment. Using a chatbot technology, this system allows the user to engage bidirectional communication with a conversational agent. The present system builds upon our previous work in which the user interacts with 3D virtual objects via voice commands. We describe, in the current document, how we integrate speech output using the Text to Speech Service (TTS API) available on the IBM Watson platform, the goal being to obtain an even more interactive system. We also employ Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) to control some features of the natural-sounding speech thus produced. Moreover, we developed Teach-Me DNA, an interactive application that gives the user (pupil, student) the opportunity to learn and/or revise the DNA molecule's basics as a part of a biological course. On one hand, and via voice inputs the user is simply able to perform 3D selections and 3D manipulations of the molecule and its several components in order to learn about their 3D features and properties, this first part dealing with the vocal entries was fully documented in a previous work. On another hand, TeachMe DNA is here enriched by producing a natural speech when reacting to the user's requests. In fact, an agent's voice is used to respond in real time to student's questions. Definitions and/or explanations are thus given in a very natural way which might immerse more significantly the student in the proposed learning environment based on augmented reality technology.

N2  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT into educational contexts is reshaping the landscape of student learning and critical thinking. This study investigates the influence of ChatGPT on the critical thinking abilities of university students by enhancing computational strategies for analysis. We developed an advanced computational framework that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to evaluate the interaction between students and ChatGPT. Our approach involves the collection and analysis of large-scale interaction data to identify patterns and impacts on critical thinking development. We employed sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and argumentation mining to decode the nature of student responses and their evolution over time. The results reveal significant improvements in critical thinking skills among students who actively engage with ChatGPT, suggesting that the AI can act as a catalyst for developing higher-order thinking skills. This study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in education by providing insights into the mechanisms through which AI tools can enhance critical thinking, and proposes practical implications for integrating such tools into academic curricula. The findings support the notion that computational analysis can provide a nuanced understanding of AIâ€™s educational impacts, paving the way for more effective AI-assisted learning environments.

N2  - With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains, the education sector is set for transformation. The potential of AI-driven tools in enhancing the learning experience, especially in programming, is immense. However, the scientific evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) used in Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) as an AI-Tutor remains largely unexplored. Therefore, there is a need to understand how students interact with such AI-Tutors and to analyze their experiences. In this paper, we conducted an exploratory case study by integrating the GPT-3.5-Turbo model as an AI-Tutor within the APAS Artemis. Through a combination of empirical data collection and an exploratory survey, we identified different user types based on their interaction patterns with the AI-Tutor. Additionally, the findings highlight advantages, such as timely feedback and scalability. However, challenges like generic responses and students' concerns about a learning progress inhibition when using the AI-Tutor were also evident. This research adds to the discourse on AI's role in education.

N2  - Students in universities regularly need to submit writing tasks, but they often encounter challenges in their writing assignments due to the lack of guidance. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, we have seen the prevalence of AI tools to help students with their writing. However, we have not heard of any AI tools to help students improve their writing regarding subject-specific content. As such, we developed an AI platform named AIReAS that could provide AI feedback for students with respect to subject-specific rubrics. We trialed this platform in a service-learning subject, and we found that AIReAS helped students incorporate rubrics and feedback into their learning, thus improving their performance in writing assignments as students understand more about teachers' expectations from the rubrics.

N2  - The rapid advancements in large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their static knowledge bases limit their applicability in dynamic, domain-specific, and personalized contexts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems address this challenge by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models to deliver real-time, contextually enriched responses. This paper implements LearnRAG, an open-source RAG framework for personalized learning that is modular in architecture, hybrid in retrieval, and fine-tuned for generation to produce adaptive educational content. A holistic case study of LearnRAG showed scalability, efficiency, increasing learner engagement, and reducing educators' workload. Issues such as multimodal integration, content accuracy, and learning styles are discussed, and strategies for ethical deployment are developed. LearnRAG offers a robust, scalable, and adaptive platform to meet the evolving needs of learners and educators worldwide, representing a paradigm shift in GenAI-driven education.

N2  - A practical problem in online learning and an important research problem in education is knowing how to predict student behaviors and performance in online learning, and implement school early warning based on the forecast results. In this study, we predict student behaviors and performance in online learning using a decision tree that uses a popular data mining strategy to construct a learning intervention model of an adaptive learning system. The results show that the male students have a highest probability of performing poorly in academics and poor total learning duration. Further, the master students have the highest probability of poor learning time span. Results also indicate that male science students have the highest probability of reduced average length of staying per study session, and the art students have the highest probability of limited discussion participation. Finally, the female art students have the highest probability of taking poor notes, while the male students have the highest probability of reduced feedback times.

N2  - This study explores the performance of large language models (LLMs) in solving competitive programming problems from the Romanian Informatics Olympiad at the county level. Romania, a leading nation in computer science competitions, provides an ideal environment for evaluating LLM capabilities due to its rich history and stringent competition standards. We collected and analyzed a dataset comprising 304 challenges from 2002 to 2023, focusing on solutions written by LLMs in C++ and Python for these problems. Our primary goal is to understand why LLMs perform well or poorly on different tasks. We evaluated various models, including closed-source models like GPT-4 and open-weight models such as CodeLlama and RoMistral, using a standardized process involving multiple attempts and feedback rounds. The analysis revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different grades and problem types. Notably, GPT-4 showed strong performance, indicating its potential use as an educational tool for middle school students. We also observed differences in code quality and style across various LLMs.

N2  - Indonesia has so many local cultures and languages that spread from Sabang to Merauke, and most Indonesians do not know how to speak two or more regional languages in Indonesia. Most Indonesians only know familiar tribes that are only commonly heard. Because of this problem, governments in the Indonesian provinces have included lessons on Indonesian culture. The lesson will explain Indonesiaâ€™s national and local culture for their area. In this way, the government can also help Indonesians learn more about their local language. This paper proposes a solution to create a learning portal website for users, both from Indonesia and other countries, to learn Indonesian culture and regional languages. In this way, the author hopes that users can learn about Indonesian local culture and language and contribute to preserving Indonesian local culture and language. This application was built on a web-based basis by applying the following HTML, CSS, and javascript using Personal Home Pages (PHP) for database connection using MySQL. The built application was designed using a use case diagram and class diagram to describe the database relations.

N2  - In this paper a real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a 3D tower crane, based on subsequent solving of three quadratic programs, is proposed. Three motions of the tower crane are considered as separate subsystems with couplings among them treated as a change in system parameters. Such linear parameter varying (LPV) system can be sampled and transformed into the corresponding polytopic model, by using a Tensor Product (TP) Model Transformation. Polytopic TP model of the tower crane is used to calculate the terminal set and the terminal cost via solving Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI). In order to guarantee recursive feasibility, system states are kept in ellipsoidal approximation of worst case initial feasible set, while the asymptotic stability is ensured by using a dual-mode MPC strategy. The proposed approach is verified through simulation and experimental test on laboratory model of a 3D tower crane.

N2  - The study aims to investigate the complex effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education (AIED) on Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). ZPD a concept introduced by Lev Vygotsky during the late 1920's, stands on the premise that the distance between actual development level (independence) and the level of potential development (dependence) lies in mentorship by adult guidance and peer collaboration. Several social-cultural theories have utilized this to analyze the relationship between instructor and learner achievement. The idea is to influence the learner's knowledge zone by active and productive interaction. It has been noted that when learners are given the opportunity to collaborate it not only motivates the learner but also influences their sociological development and this helps to bolster their already established knowledge. However, the role of AI on the ZPD of the learner creates a dichotomy that needs further exploration. A ubiquitous AI educational setting may encourage learners to remain passive rather than foster participatory behaviour and positive outcome. These inclinations toward passive compliance are evident in the concept of AI systems enabling"" personalized learning,"" which departs from the theory of learning as a social action and civic engagement. We further explore the role of motivation through the ARCS model in minimizing an adverse effect of AI on a learner's ZPD.

N2  - INES (INtelligent Educational System) is a functional prototype of an online learning platform, which combines three essential capabilities related to e-learning activities. These capabilities are those concerning to a LMS (learning management system), a LCMS (learning content management system), and an ITS (intelligent tutoring system). To carry out all this functionalities, our system, as a whole, comprises a set different tools and technologies, as follows: semantic managing users (administrators, teachers, students...) and contents tools, an intelligent chatterbot able to communicate with students in natural language, an intelligent agent based on BDI (believes, desires, intentions) technology that acts as the brain of the system, an inference engine based on JESS (a rule engine for the Java platform) and ontologies (to modelled the user, his/her activities, and the learning contents) that contribute with the semantics of the system, etc. At the present paper we will focus on the chatterbot, CHARLIE (CHAtteR Learning Interface Entity), developed and used in the platform, which is an AIML-based (artificial intelligence markup language) bot. We will specifically address its performance and its contribution to INES.

N2  - The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge for humanity. The historical data about the past pandemics indicates towards a high possibility of future pandemics. Moreover, current pandemic is expected to stay for longer time. In this situation, social robots hold a huge potential to assist in fighting against current and future pandemics by minimizing human-to-human interactions e.g., by providing digital help desk, and monitoring the compliance of people with required safety measures at public places. A huge number of robots are required to monitor large spaces like shopping malls, airports etc. Therefore, we present Multi-Agent System (MAS) to provide robot based mobile help desk and monitoring safety measure of wearing face mask, for large spaces in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Our proposed MAS is based on collaborative work of two agents: 1) CCTV Camera, and 2) Robot. Experimental results show efficiency and effectiveness of proposed MAS in navigation and control of robot based on visual information interpreted by CCTV camera to provide mobile help desk, and detecting face masks through robot by using state-of-the-art real-time computer vision algorithms in large spaces.

N2  - In the digital age, AI and education is an intersection that open up endless possibilities for literacy improvement. Artificial intelligence-powered language learning tools today play an important role in nurturing literacy across diverse populations, expanding beyond traditional literacy skills to include competencies of digital literacies. AI in education enables personalised, adaptive learning experiences that can meet the needs of each individual learner and often result in higher levels of engagement and improved outcomes. AI-based language learning platforms use natural language processing (NLP), machine-learning and data analytics to generate personalized educational content and feedback loops. They offer the advantage when it comes to diagnosis of where learning gaps lie for each individual student, can provide tailor made exercises and give instant seamless feedback making a great process in learning by being efficient. AI can also help teachers by handling the administrative duties they typically must deal with, freeing that time up to devote more attention and focus on instructional methodologies as well as student engagement. Instead, what the paper does is to address some of the use-cases for AI in language learning - like intelligent tutoring systems, chatbots and adaptive learning platforms. In other words, intelligent tutoring systems can mimick one on one tutoring experiences by leading learners through a personalized learning path. Utilizing NLP, Chatbots conduct interactive dialogues with students to practice reading and writing activities as well comprehension.

N2  - This paper presents the Smart Learning Assistant on the German MOOC platform AI-Campus. It is an AI-powered, dialog-based system that provides learners with personalized learning support and features for enhanced learning. The paper presents the original motivation and planned features of the Smart Learning Assistant as well as its technical implementation, architecture, and status quo. An initial evaluation was conducted using event logs from the dialog system and an integrated feedback loop. It shows that learners start to use the learning assistant and are also engaged in long conversations. Frequent topics of conversation are related to the user's profile, more information about AI-Campus, information about AI, or reporting an error. However, the initial analysis has also shown that users are not yet satisfied with the first assistant and that the list of topics and functions as well as the conversation guidance need to be expanded. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions for AI development and integration in MOOC platforms, including the need for continued evaluation and refinement of AI-enabled educational technologies. In addition, an overview of future functionalities and opportunities for improvement is provided. Overall, this paper contributes to the understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of AI in education and sheds light on the role of a Smart Learning Assistant in enhancing personalized learning experiences on MOOC platforms.

N2  - This paper explores and evaluates the use of OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT-4o as a feedback tool for engineering drawings. The AI feedback tool was trained on a synthetic dataset specifically created for the task, which included a comprehensive checklist derived from the Australian Standard for Technical Drawings (AS 1100) and a variety of engineering drawing examples. The evaluation involved repeated testing of three distinct case studies, each representing different levels of drawing accuracy. The findings reveal both strengths and weaknesses in the AI feedback toolâ€™s performance, providing valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in providing feedback on engineering drawings in the education context. The research also highlights the need for further training to improve accuracy in certain areas and the potential bias in the evaluation process. A key observation from this study is that while Open AIâ€™s ChatGPT-4o model can generate feedback, it may not truly â€˜understandâ€™ the engineering drawings in the same way a human would. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to leverage AI in education, particularly in the context of engineering drawing feedback, and underscores the importance of human oversight and intervention in the application of AI technology.

N2  - The Work-Study Diploma (WSDip) offered by Institute of Technical Education Singapore (ITE), is a unique 2.5-year apprenticeship-based programme, where ITE graduates gain a head start in their career whilst pursing a nationally recognised diploma. As it is an apprenticeship-based programme, trainees enrolled into the programme spend majority of their workweek at work, with a dedicated one day of learning at the College. Majority of the knowledge and skills learnt by the trainees are new, as the qualification caters to vertical industries such as Security Operations (WSDip in Security Operations, DPSCO). One of the challenges when learning new knowledge is uncertainty. Trainees need constant guidance and mentorship by the teacher to clarify doubts that the trainees have when comprehending new knowledge. On top of that, trainees tend to forget newly learned contents, in a matter of days, unless trainees consciously review the learned contents. According to Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve [1], information is lost over time if not revisited. DPSCO pilot the use of noodlefactory.ai, a unique AI teaching assistant platform that leverages the power of AI to bring automation and efficiency of learning to the trainees by being their 24/7 AI tutor. Noodlefactory.ai allows repeated practice allowing knowledge and skills retention.

N2  - The emergence and subsequent widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Language models such as ChatGPT and Google Bard has sparked intense interest in the capabilities and applications of AI language models in education and language learning. However, not much is known about how AI language models perform linguistically. This study examined the effects of AI language models, ChatGPT and Bard, on the writing quality and linguistic features (i.e., lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and cohesion) of AI written output. Data was collected from both AI language models, which were tasked to answer a total of 120 essay prompts on topics ranging from Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Science. The responses generated from both AI language models were analyzed for their writing quality, lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and cohesion. Results revealed that ChatGPT is stronger in producing higher quality text which uses more sophisticated words and complex sentences, whereas Bard is stronger in creating more cohesive texts. Results of the study are discussed in the context of AI language modelsâ€™ training methods, and implications for using AI in education, as well as, language teaching and learning.

N2  - Competitive programming presents challenges for students seeking to enhance programming and algorithmic skills. This research introduces a system that efficiently matches problem statements to editorials that describe the solution, helping students find relevant learning resources. The main component of this system is our learning-to-rank model, which achieves a P@1 score of 0.93, indicating its proficiency in identifying the most relevant editorial for a specific problem statement. While our model is smaller in scale compared to general models like GPT-4, it distinguishes itself with comparable results and notable computational efficiency. Additionally, we have developed a new dataset of 1550 competitive programming problem statements and their editorials. Integrated into a competitive programming platform, it has the potential to evolve into an adaptive learning system, customizing paths based on individual user performance. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/DinuGeorge0019/MatchingProblemStatementsToEditorialsInCP.

N2  - The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in transforming education has received considerable attention. This study aims to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) in assisting students with studying and passing standardized exams, while many people think it is a hype situation. Using primary education as an example, this research investigates whether ChatGPT-3.5 can achieve satisfactory performance on the Chinese Primary School Exams and whether it can be used as a teaching aid or tutor. We designed an experimental framework and constructed a benchmark that comprises 4800 questions collected from 48 tasks in Chinese elementary education settings. Through automatic and manual evaluations, we observed that ChatGPT-3.5â€™s pass rate was below the required level of accuracy for most tasks, and the correctness of ChatGPT-3.5â€™s answer interpretation was unsatisfactory. These results revealed a discrepancy between the findings and our initial expectations. However, the comparative experiments between ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 indicated significant improvements in model performance, demonstrating the potential of using LLMs as a teaching aid. This article also investigates the use of the trans-prompting strategy to reduce the impact of language bias and enhance question understanding. We present a comparison of the models' performance and the improvement under the trans-lingual problem decomposition prompting mechanism. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with the appropriate application of AI-driven language models, along with future directions and limitations in the field of AI for education.
