AB  - This research full paper proposes an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to support the study of software project management, considering the students' learning styles. The learning process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that varies significantly from one person to another. Everyone absorbs knowledge differently because each has learning characteristics that directly impact the learning process. Ignoring these differences can result in inefficient and demotivating teaching. Therefore, teachers must invest time in understanding each student's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses, which can be overwhelming, especially in classrooms with a high student-teacher ratio. In this scenario, AI-based technology can be a strong ally. For example, chatbot technology offers an opportunity to adapt to these individual differences and to enable a more engaging and friendly approach for students, contributing to an active and interactive learning environment when exercising the role of a study companion and, why not, a bit of study guide. In this context, this paper proposes developing and applying a chatbot-based ITS called Juh to identify each student's learning style and, based on this understanding, present study activities appropriate to their learning style. The ITS uses meaningful learning theory to personalize the learning journey, detecting five profiles: active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative. This study chose project management (PM) as its knowledge area, particularly project management methodologies, aiming to evaluate the benefits of this research proposal. In this context, this research proposes to answer the following research question: RQ) How can the study of project management be supported actively and interactively, considering the students' learning styles? As its main contribution, the solution aims to offer support in the introduction to the study of project management and improve the learning experience according to the individual characteristics of each student, maximizing the assimilation of knowledge. Therefore, the difference lies in exploring how and what to learn. The solution was developed using the Design Science Research method and the low code Blip platform. After prototyping and evaluating the ITS with PM and education experts, promising points about the approach were observed, with users highlighting improvements in productivity and ease of use of the tutoring system.

AB  - With increasing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) in the education industry, intelligent tutoring system (ITS) powered by AI have been widely adopted to optimize the learning experience. However, the relationship between students’ engagement level of Generative AI (GenAI) and their academic performance is still under exploration. Also current popular GenAI products like ChatGPT suffer from the hallucination problem, which includes factuality, faithfulness, and maliciousness issues in the generated answer. This paper presents GPTutor, an ITS leveraging GenAI to support students' learning processes. GPTutor integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver actual and contextually rich answers aligned to student questions and intended learning outcomes (ILO). A pilot evaluation involving undergraduate and postgraduate students assessed the system’s association with user experience, engagement, and academic performance. Results demonstrated that students generally recognize the effectiveness of GPTutor. Some students also provided insightful feedback on the benefits of GPTutor in improving learning efficiency and some limitations to be addressed. Notably, students with higher engagement levels showed significantly better academic performance on the final exam. This study proposed GPTutor to provide an interactive and knowledge-grounded learning experience and showed the strong association between students’ engagement in GPTutor and academic performance.

AB  - LLM-based tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the like have already arrived in software development practice, and continue to change the way of how software is created. Students use Generative AI tools for any purpose, whether we agree with the use or not. In this paper, we argue that in order to appropriately prepare our students for professional life, we educators need to incorporate the use of these tools explicitly into the teaching and learning process, so that students will learn a systematic and professional usage of these tools. Teaching basic software development concepts to students with only little or no prior knowledge has always been a challenge. Incorporating GenAI-based tools into software development education requires some careful rethinking of teaching concepts, especially with respect to constructive alignment, i. e. aligning learning objectives, teaching and learning methods, and exams to address GenAI-based support. Based upon first observations on the usage of GenAI tools in class, in this paper we suggest and compare concepts for teaching and learning basic software development that integrate GenAI tools at different levels of intensity and at different points during a semester. From these observations, we derive recommendations both for teaching and learning settings and for corresponding assessments, for teaching software development in a constructively aligned way in the age of GenAI tools.

AB  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are fundamental to modern web development, yet many learners encounter significant challenges with its intricate syntax and extensive styling capabilities. Approximately 85.7% of students report difficulties in mastering CSS concepts, which are often compounded by motivational issues that hinder the learning process. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a web-based educational application designed to enhance CSS learning through the integration of an innovative pedagogical agent that employs advanced scaffolding methods. The application utilizes a dual-phase scaffolding approach, including procedural scaffolding, which offers structured guidance through pre-designed dialogues, and strategic scaffolding, which employs ChatGPT to deliver personalized, adaptive feedback tailored to individual learning needs. The implementation of these scaffolding techniques has led to significant improvements in both user engagement and learning outcomes. Thematic analysis revealed that 80% of participants found the learning style provided by the pedagogical agent aligned with their personal preferences, compared to only 40% with conventional methods. Additionally, 90% of participants experienced increased motivation using the application with the pedagogical agent, versus 40% with the conventional approach. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pedagogical agent in fostering a personalized and engaging learning experience, enhancing both motivation and learning. This research lays the chance for future advancements in interactive and adaptive learning systems, demonstrating the potential of combining pedagogical agents with sophisticated language models like ChatGPT to address educational and motivational challenges.

AB  - The 2023 CS curriculum by ACM, IEEE, and AAAI identifies security as an independent knowledge area that develops the “security mindset” so that students are ready for the “continual changes” in computing. Likewise, the curriculum emphasises the coverage of “uses”, and “shortcomings/pitfalls” of practical AI-tools like ChatGPT. This paper presents our endeavors to approach those goals with the design of an Information Security course. Our course design bears the following distinct features: Certificate-readiness, where we align the knowledge areas with major security/ethical hacking certificates; Coverage of ChatGPT, where the uses of ChatGPT for assisting security tasks and security issues caused by ChatGPT usage are both addressed for the first time in the teaching; “Learn defending from attackers' perspective”, where labs of both offensive and defensive natures are developed to equally sharpen ethical hacking and hardening skills, and to facilitate the discussion on legal/ethical implications; Current and Representative, where ajust-enough set of representative and/or current security topics are selected in order and covered in respective modules in the most current form. In addition, we generalize our design principles and strategies, with the hope to shed lights on similar efforts in other institutions.

AB  - The transformative potential of Generative AI (GenAI) in higher education necessitates a critical examination of its ethical integration, particularly in fostering sex-gender equity and ensuring human-centric innovation. This paper addresses the multifaceted impact of GenAI, exploring both its opportunities and the ethical challenges it presents within educational contexts. As AI technologies, including large language models and diffusion models, rapidly advance, concerns regarding bias, privacy, accountability, and explainability in their application to educational settings must be addressed. It argues that ethical considerations must guide the integration of AI into educational systems, with a particular focus on gender equity and the promotion of inclusive learning environments. The rise of personalized learning, facilitated by AI systems, offers vast potential for tailoring educational experiences to individual needs. However, it also raises significant risks, including algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and the unintended misuse of AI technologies by students in ways that may perpetuate social inequities or ethical lapses. It underscores the urgent need for higher education institutions to address the ethics education gap, ensuring that students are not only equipped with cutting-edge technical knowledge but also a deep understanding of the societal and ethical implications of AI technologies. To bridge this gap, we propose practical strategies for the ethical integration of GenAI in education. These include project-based learning, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and comprehensive faculty development programs aimed at embedding ethical decision-making frameworks within AI curricula. By cultivating a cultural ethical responsibility, higher education can foster an environment where AI innovation is pursued with a commitment to social justice, diversity, and inclusion. Rooted in the X.0 wave, which highlights the evolution of technological paradigms from traditional models to the next wave of innovation, this paper aligns with the principles of Industry X.0 (when X.0 = 5.0). This theory emphasizes humancentric innovation, sustainability, and ethical responsibility as foundational elements for future technological advancements. In this context, it provides a roadmap for the responsible use of AI in education, advocating for the integration of human welfare as a guiding principle in AI-driven innovation. This ensures that AI technologies are utilized as tools for advancing societal well-being rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. By applying X.0 theory, this research calls for a paradigm shift in higher education—one that prioritizes ethical AI education and prepares students to lead with responsibility, equity, and integrity as they navigate the evolving technological landscape.

AB  - This research full paper describes a web-based online learning platform that delivers financial literacy lessons via talking head videos of AI-generated personas with two additional core features: LLM-powered proactive chat-based question-and-answer interactivity, and personal choice of the AI instructor from a list of distinct personas. We conducted two comparative studies with a total of 233 Thai students aged 1825, which aim to 1) investigate the impact of interactivity and instructor selection on the learning experience, and 2) further explore the underlying factors at play with instructor selection by introducing AI instructors' backstories as an extra intervention. We found that enabling interactivity significantly enhanced learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and virtual instructors' humanness compared to the passive setting. Providing learners with a choice of AI instructors provided minimal additional benefit. However, the learner's feeling of relatedness toward the instructor is a significant positive predictor of learning motivation, positive emotion, and agent credibility, while goal alignment with the agent correlates with perceived learning facilitation, and admiration corresponds with perceived agent humanness. These findings underscore the potential of interactive virtual instructors-ones that interactively encourage learners to reflect on the teaching materials throughout the lesson through two-way interaction-in enhancing motivational and experiential aspects of remote education, even if they do not significantly impact comprehension, and the importance of promoting learner's relatedness and goal alignment with the agent in boosting other aspects of the learning experience.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, and education is no exception. The growing popularity and use of AI systems calls for a new understanding of what it means to be literate in the modern world. Thus, it is crucial for individuals to develop AI-driven critical thinking skills to effectively interact with these technologies. However, existing research focuses mainly on the "how" of AI integration, with limited exploration of the "why" and "how" of fostering critical engagement with AI tools. In this article, we propose an extension to DigCompEdu that aligns with the UNESCO pillars of education. This extension highlights five key elements that challenge critical thinking capabilities in relation to AI: "know-what," "know-who," "know-where," "know-how," and "know-why". By combining critical thinking skills with AI functionalities, educators can empower students to become responsible and informed digital citizens in the era of generative AI.

AB  - Open-domain factoid question-answering (ODFQA) aims to answer questions posed in natural language by retrieving and extracting relevant information from large, unstructured text sources. A range of applications have benefited from ODFQA including improved search relevancy in search engines and information retrieval, enable semantic searches, interactive and personalized learning systems, and the creation of large language models. Although significant research on ODFQA for English and other languages has been done, Urdu-specific research in this area remains limited. This is due to the lack of high-quality datasets and the challenges associated with processing Urdu text. To address the unavailability of Urdu-specific resources for the ODFQA task, we developed a benchmark corpus, comprising  $3,985$  Urdu questions and corresponding Urdu Wikipedia articles, with  $1,006$  answerable and  $2,979$  unanswerable questions. Each question in our proposed corpus was manually annotated by three independent annotators. As a secondary contribution, we carried out extensive experimentation using a range of state- of-the-art models, including retrievers (BM25 and Sentence-BERT), multilingual transformers (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa-Large, XLM-RoBERTa-Large-Squad2), and large language models (GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18) on our proposed corpus. Best results were obtained using the XLM-RoBERTa-Large-Squad2 model with  $F_{1} = 0.61$  and  $EM = 0.41 \text{@}k = 20$ . While the finetuned GPT-4o-mini model was the best model, with  $F_{1} = 0.81$  and  $EM = 0.81 \text{@}k=1$ . To foster research in the Urdu ODFQA, our proposed corpus is freely available under the Creative Commons license.

AB  - This paper investigates the implementation of AI-driven feedback in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) developed for training of counselors. By using LLMs, the study explores the automatic generation of feedback for communication-intensive tasks such as online counseling. The evaluation compares different feedback methods, including the sandwich, WWW and STATE methods, and assesses their emotional and objective impact. The results show that AI-generated feedback fulfills objective criteria better than emotional ones. Fine-tuning an open source LLM can improve both the emotional and objective quality of feedback. Furthermore, the study examines the acceptance of AI feedback among aspiring counselors, highlighting the influence of familiarity with AI on acceptance levels. Ethical considerations, including bias and hallucination, are addressed, with recommendations for risk mitigation through multi-feedback options and expert supervision. This research contributes to the understanding of the role of AI in improving digital counseling practices and highlights the need for continuous evaluation and ethical considerations.

AB  - The NLP-driven Learning Platform for Personalized Education will revolutionize educational experiences through the integration of Artificial Intelligence in improved adaptive learning. Other than typical systems, this platform powered by adaptive learning models, sentiment analysis, and gamification creates personalized instruction that best aligns with each student's cognitive and emotional state. For instance, the platform makes use of NLP models in the forms of Rasa for dialogue management and TensorFlow for adaptive algorithms [2]; it measures learning patterns, emotional signals, and progress for its system of adjusting difficulty levels, feedback, and engagement. Preliminary test results indicate that this system can improve academic outcomes and increase student satisfaction through enhanced interactivity and support [4]. This paper covers the design, implementation, and expected impacts of such an innovative approach to the educational landscape, particularly in view of the Education 4.0 and 5.0 frameworks that are turning more personalized and adaptive.

AB  - Writing assessment is one of the most important stages in the educational process, but it is also the most resource-demanding one. To address the challenges of scalability and inconsistency, this study proposes a Transformer-LSTM model for automated scoring and feedback generation, enhancing accuracy and reliability in assessment. Integrating the contextual reading abilities of transformers with the sequential analysis strength of LSTMs, the model analyzes significant metrics of writing quality, including grammar, coherence, and structure, while providing individualized, actionable feedback. Using annotated datasets and evaluation metrics like RMSE and feedback relevance, it was established that the model performs well overall and that improvements in grammar and coherence seemed to be the most significant contributors to writing ability. It was also demonstrated that feedback relevance enhances these outcomes, thus confirming its valuable role in promoting structural and grammatical accuracy. Understanding that most existing systems do not encourage significant human feedback, this work demonstrates a scalable approach with potential alignment with human evaluation standards. Finally, this study shows hybrid models’ promise for automated writing assessment as promising scalable, equitable, impact-based tools for global enhancement of educational outcomes.

AB  - The automatic generation of reading comprehension questions, referred to as question generation (QG), is attracting attention in the field of education. To achieve efficient educational applications of QG methods, it is desirable to generate questions with difficulty levels that are appropriate for each learner's reading ability. Therefore, in recent years, several difficulty-controllable QG methods have been proposed. However, conventional methods generate only questions and cannot produce question–answer pairs. Furthermore, such methods ignore the relationship between question difficulty and learner ability, making it challenging to ascertain the appropriate difficulty levels for each learner. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a method for generating question–answer pairs based on difficulty, defined using a statistical model known as item response theory. The proposed difficulty-controllable generation is achieved by extending two pretrained transformer models: bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and text-to-text transfer transformer. In addition, because learners' abilities are generally not knowable in advance, we propose an adaptive QG framework that efficiently estimates the learners' abilities while generating and presenting questions with difficulty levels suitable for their abilities. Through experiments involving real data, we confirmed that the proposed method can generate question–answer pairs with difficulty levels that align with the learners' abilities while efficiently estimating their abilities.

AB  - Knowledge tracing (KT) is essential in intelligent tutoring systems for tracking learners' knowledge states and predicting their future performance. Numerous prevailing KT methods prioritize modeling learners' behavioral patterns in acquiring knowledge and the relationship among interactions. However, due to the sparsity problem, they frequently encounter challenges in effectively uncovering latent contextual features embedded within the learning sequences. This limitation may impose certain constraints on the predictive performance. In light of this concern, this article focuses on extracting latent features from learning sequences to enhance the assessment of knowledge states. Consequently, we design optimized pretraining mechanisms and introduce an enhanced deep KT method, optimized pretraining deep KT (OPKT). In the pretraining phase, the self-supervised learning approach is effectively employed to train comprehensive contextual encodings of the learning sequences. During fine-tuning, the contextual encodings are transferred to the downstream KT model, which then generates the knowledge states and makes predictions. Through our experiments, the superiority of our method over six existing KT models on five publicly available datasets is demonstrated. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies and visualized analysis validate the rationality and effectiveness of every component of the OPKT architecture.

AB  - Personalized e-learning systems have transformed the delivery of educational content, aligning it more closely with individual learners’ needs. Among the various approaches to achieving this personalization, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality prediction emerged as a valuable tool for adapting learning content to match individual preferences and learning styles. Despite these advancements, personalized e-learning systems quite struggle with handling large volumes of information, often facing difficulties in balancing prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. To ensure personalization, integrating advanced technologies such as machine learning and deep learning is crucial for creating more sustainable and effective learning environments. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates MBTI personality prediction with a deep learning approach and a Learner Profile ontology (LPO) to enhance the personalization and recommendation process. The proposed method employs the BERT model, a Transformer-based architecture, for personality prediction, combined with an oversampling technique to handle data imbalance. The predicted personality type is incorporated into a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)-based ontology enriched with WordNet, enabling better alignment of learning resources with individual learner traits. Experimental results validate the efficacy of this integrated approach, demonstrating significant improvements in learner satisfaction and educational outcomes.
