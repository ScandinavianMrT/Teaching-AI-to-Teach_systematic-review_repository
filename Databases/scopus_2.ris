AB  - As digital education transcends traditional boundaries, e-learning experiences are increasingly shaped by cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and adaptive learning systems. This study examines the integration of AI-driven personalized instruction within immersive VR environments, targeting enhanced learner engagement-a core metric in online education effectiveness. Employing a user-centric design, the research utilizes embodied AI tutors, calibrated to individual learners’ emotional intelligence and cognitive states, within a Python programming curriculum-a key area in computer science education. The methodology relies on intelligent tutoring systems and personalized learning pathways, catering to a diverse participant pool from Virginia Tech. Our data-driven approach, underpinned by the principles of educational psychology and computational pedagogy, indicates that AI-enhanced virtual learning environments significantly elevate user engagement and proficiency in programming education. Although the scope is limited to a single academic institution, the promising results advocate for the scalability of such AI-powered educational tools, with potential implications for distance learning, MOOCs, and lifelong learning platforms. This research contributes to the evolving narrative of smart education and the role of large language models (LLMs) in crafting bespoke educational experiences, suggesting a paradigm shift towards more interactive, personalized e-learning solutions that align with global educational technology trends. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - As AI tools become common across jobs and industries, it is critical to broaden education about AI beyond teaching computer scientists how to build AI systems. To expand AI education, we are researching AI for AI learning: a personalized and adaptive learning system that integrates dialog-based tutoring and gamified programming activities. To study this problem, we adapted and expanded an existing smartphone adaptive coach to develop the Game-if-AI system. Using a design-based research approach, Game-if-AI was iteratively tested and improved across four semesters of optional use in a course designed for technician-level understanding of AI: mastering programming skills to apply AI libraries and established models. In this study, we measured the interests and needs of these technical learners, based on both survey data and on how they engaged with topics in the system. Based on this data, new topics were added and the system was refined. In this paper, we report students’ usability ratings for system components and student preferences based on completion rates of AI topics available each semester. Students rated the adaptive system positively overall (93% rated as a “good idea”), but more complex learning activities (tutoring dialogs, programming) were rated lower than traditional ones (e.g., multiple choice, reading). Students were most likely to master topics highly aligned to the course materials, as well as self-directed learning toward easier high-interest topics (e.g., LLM Prompting).

AB  - In this study, we explore the efficacy of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in the tasks of constructing and completing Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs). Knowledge Graphs (KGs) help represent real-world relationships. This can take the form of modeling course domains and student progression in educational settings. Through this work, we leverage GPT-4 to aid KG construction and align it with predefined learning objectives, course structure, and human interaction in validating and refining the generated KGs. The methodology employed utilized prompting LLMs with course materials and evaluating the generation of KGs through automatic and human assessment. Through a series of experiments, we show the potential of LLMs in enhancing the EduKG construction process, particularly for course modeling. Our findings suggest that LLMs such as GPT-4 can augment EduKGs by suggesting valuable and contextually relevant triplets. This KG creation and augmentation approach shows the potential to reduce the workload on educators and adaptive learning systems, paving the way for future applications in content recommendation and personalized learning experiences. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Writing assessment is one of the most important stages in the educational process, but it is also the most resource-demanding one. To address the challenges of scalability and inconsistency, this study proposes a Transformer-LSTM model for automated scoring and feedback generation, enhancing accuracy and reliability in assessment. Integrating the contextual reading abilities of transformers with the sequential analysis strength of LSTMs, the model analyzes significant metrics of writing quality, including grammar, coherence, and structure, while providing individualized, actionable feedback. Using annotated datasets and evaluation metrics like RMSE and feedback relevance, it was established that the model performs well overall and that improvements in grammar and coherence seemed to be the most significant contributors to writing ability. It was also demonstrated that feedback relevance enhances these outcomes, thus confirming its valuable role in promoting structural and grammatical accuracy. Understanding that most existing systems do not encourage significant human feedback, this work demonstrates a scalable approach with potential alignment with human evaluation standards. Finally, this study shows hybrid models’ promise for automated writing assessment as promising scalable, equitable, impact-based tools for global enhancement of educational outcomes. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Teachers who wish to enact lessons about generative AI are required to simultaneously learn about it and develop curricula with activities that align with their discipline. We present two cases of high school teachers, June and Margot, who had different prior experiences, resources, and learning goals related to GenAI instruction. We found that they designed lessons that positioned GenAI as an object-of-study or subject-specific, but neither lesson solely focused on either approach. Prior disciplinary and lesson planning knowledge and in-the moment student reactions to activities shaped their appraisals of lesson effectiveness. However, we observed that co-design experiences and activities were central for helping to develop teachers’ pedagogical design capacity for GenAI. We contribute two cases that illustrate how co-design can support high school teachers who wish to integrate GenAI into their discipline, and by offering contrasting models of pedagogical approaches. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of advanced large language models (LLMs) including GPT, BART, BERT, and T5, fine-tuned using a specialized FAQ dataset from ESTIN, a higher education institution. The study aims to assess the performance of these LLM models in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses to common queries. These models were evaluated using key metrics such as evaluation loss (eval loss) and ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2), which measure the alignment between the generated responses and the reference answers. The experiment results show that BERT outperforms the other models, achieving a lowest eval loss and highest ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, making it the most effective model in this context. The findings underscore the potential of BERT in educational AI applications. Finally, some future research directions are discussed, including the integration of additional models and the enhancement of the FAQ dataset to further improve performance. ©2024 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: In 2022 generative AI took the Internet world by storm. Free access to tools that can generate text and images that pass for human creations triggered fiery debates about the potential uses and misuses of generative AI in education. There has risen a need to check the popular utopian and dystopian narratives about AI against the diversity of hopes, concerns and future imaginaries that educators themselves associate with generative AI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perspectives of Finnish teacher educators on the use of AI in education. Design/methodology/approach: This article reports findings from a hands-on workshop in teacher training, where participants learned about how generative AI works, collaboratively explored generative AI and then reflected on its potential and challenges. Findings: The results reveal nuanced, calm and thoughtful imaginaries rooted in deep understanding of educational policy, evaluation and the sociocultural context of education. The results cover teachers’ views on the impact of AI on learners’ agency, metacognition, self-regulation and more. Originality/value: This article offers a unique exploration into the perceptions and imaginaries of educators regarding generative AI in specific (instead of “monolithic AI”), moving beyond dystopian views and instead focusing on the potential of AI to align with existing pedagogical practices. The educators contrasted the common techno-deterministic narratives and perceived AI as an avenue to support formative assessment practices and development of metacognition, self-regulation, responsibility and well-being. The novel insights also include the need for AI education that critically incorporates social and ethical viewpoints and fosters visions for a future with culturally, socially and environmentally sustainable AI. © 2024, Henriikka Vartiainen, Teemu Valtonen, Juho Kahila and Matti Tedre.

AB  - Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized learning and support is becoming a promising tool in computing education. AI Assistants can help students with programming, problem-solving, converse with them to clarify course content, explain error messages to help with debugging, and much more. However, using cloud-based LLMs poses risks around data security, privacy, but also control of the overarching system. To address these concerns, we created a locally-stored Small Language Model (SLM) that leverages different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. We compare one SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 - fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1) against two popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) to see the viability for computing educators to use in their course(s). We use conversations from a CS1 course (N = 1,260), providing students with an AI Assistant (using gpt-3.5-turbo) to help them learn content and support problem-solving while completing their Python programming assignment. In total, we had 269 students use the AI Assistant, with a total of 1,988 questions asked. Using this real conversational data, we re-ran student questions using our novel SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 testing nine different RAG methods) and gpt-4-32k, then compared those results against the original gpt-3.5-turbo responses. Our findings indicate that using an SLM with RAG can perform similarly, if not better, than LLMs. This shows that it is possible for computing educators to use SLMs (with RAG) in their course(s) as a tool for scalable learning, supporting content understanding and problem-solving needs, while employing their own policies on data privacy and security. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - The development of technology has marked great changes in all areas, especially in education, the incorporation of various tools supported by artificial intelligence has brought positive and negative consequences, in many cases there is a lack of knowledge of these and therefore they have not been properly used. This study attempts to evaluate and compare some generative language tools through a literature search and their practical use. Using content analysis, the seven selected tools were compared considering the criteria of: Efficiency, Quality, Usability, Scalability and Costs. The results show that tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Whisper, Hugging Face and Grammarly stand out for their high efficiency, quality, usability and scalability, being the most robust options for various educational applications. While tools such as Google Bard and Khan Academy's AI Tutor offer good evaluations in usability and scalability, with relatively low costs, making them accessible and effective in educational environments.

AB  - Contextualizing problems to align with student interests can significantly improve learning outcomes. However, this task often presents scalability challenges due to resource and time constraints. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 [1]offer potential solutions to these issues. This study explores the ability of GPT-4 in the contextualization of problems within CTAT [2], an authoring tool for the intelligent tutoring system, aiming to increase student engagement and enhance learning outcomes. Through iterative prompt engineering, we achieved meaningful contextualization that preserved the difficulty and original intent of the problem, thereby not altering values or overcomplicating the questions. To evaluate the effectiveness of these newly generated questions, we conducted focus groups and interviews with instructional designers. The positive assessment from the instructional designers signifies that these questions are suitable for implementation, potentially saving significant time spent on manual contextualization. Despite these promising findings, we acknowledge current limitations of our research, particularly with geometry problems, and emphasize the need for ongoing evaluation and research. Future work includes systematic studies to measure the impact of this tool on students' learning outcomes and enhancements to handle a broader range of problems. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The transformative potential of Generative AI (GenAI) in higher education necessitates a critical examination of its ethical integration, particularly in fostering sex-gender equity and ensuring human-centric innovation. This paper addresses the multifaceted impact of GenAI, exploring both its opportunities and the ethical challenges it presents within educational contexts. As AI technologies, including large language models and diffusion models, rapidly advance, concerns regarding bias, privacy, accountability, and explainability in their application to educational settings must be addressed. It argues that ethical considerations must guide the integration of AI into educational systems, with a particular focus on gender equity and the promotion of inclusive learning environments. The rise of personalized learning, facilitated by AI systems, offers vast potential for tailoring educational experiences to individual needs. However, it also raises significant risks, including algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and the unintended misuse of AI technologies by students in ways that may perpetuate social inequities or ethical lapses. It underscores the urgent need for higher education institutions to address the ethics education gap, ensuring that students are not only equipped with cutting-edge technical knowledge but also a deep understanding of the societal and ethical implications of AI technologies. To bridge this gap, we propose practical strategies for the ethical integration of GenAI in education. These include project-based learning, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and comprehensive faculty development programs aimed at embedding ethical decision-making frameworks within AI curricula. By cultivating a cultural ethical responsibility, higher education can foster an environment where AI innovation is pursued with a commitment to social justice, diversity, and inclusion. Rooted in the X.0 wave, which highlights the evolution of technological paradigms from traditional models to the next wave of innovation, this paper aligns with the principles of Industry X.0 (when X.0 = 5.0). This theory emphasizes humancentric innovation, sustainability, and ethical responsibility as foundational elements for future technological advancements. In this context, it provides a roadmap for the responsible use of AI in education, advocating for the integration of human welfare as a guiding principle in AI-driven innovation. This ensures that AI technologies are utilized as tools for advancing societal well-being rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. By applying X.0 theory, this research calls for a paradigm shift in higher education - one that prioritizes ethical AI education and prepares students to lead with responsibility, equity, and integrity as they navigate the evolving technological landscape. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Since the conception of Large Language Models (LLMs), their areas of application have increased significantly over time. This is due to their nature of being able to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks (like question answering, text generation, text summarization, text classification etc.), which gives them flexibility in a multitude of spaces, including in Educational AI (EdAI). Despite their incredible wide range of use, LLMs are typically applied to generative AI, from text to image generation.This paper aims to apply LLMs for a classification task in EdAI, by reproposing the original PreSS (Predicting Student Success) model which makes use of more traditional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for predicting CS1 students at risk of failing or dropping out. There are two main goals for this work: the first is to identify the best and most accurate method to re-purpose LLMs for a classification task; the second is to explore and access the explainability of the model outputs. For the former we investigate different techniques for using LLMs like Few-Shot Prompting, Fine-Tuning and Transfer Learning using Gemma 2B as base model along with two different kind of prompting techniques. For the latter we focus on attention scores of LLMs transformers, aiming to understanding what are the most important features that the model considers for generating the response. The obtained results are then compared with the previous PreSS model to evaluate whether LLMs can outperform traditional ML algorithms: this paper finds that Naïve Bayes still outperforms all the others, once again confirmed as the best algorithm for predicting student success. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - With increasing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) in the education industry, intelligent tutoring system (ITS) powered by AI have been widely adopted to optimize the learning experience. However, the relationship between students' engagement level of Generative AI (GenAI) and their academic performance is still under exploration. Also current popular GenAI products like ChatGPT suffer from the hallucination problem, which includes factuality, faithfulness, and maliciousness issues in the generated answer. This paper presents GPTutor, an ITS leveraging GenAI to support students' learning processes. GPTutor integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver actual and contextually rich answers aligned to student questions and intended learning outcomes (ILO). A pilot evaluation involving undergraduate and postgraduate students assessed the system's association with user experience, engagement, and academic performance. Results demonstrated that students generally recognize the effectiveness of GPTutor. Some students also provided insightful feedback on the benefits of GPTutor in improving learning efficiency and some limitations to be addressed. Notably, students with higher engagement levels showed significantly better academic performance on the final exam. This study proposed GPTutor to provide an interactive and knowledge-grounded learning experience and showed the strong association between students' engagement in GPTutor and academic performance.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Current research aims to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for tutoring beginning programming students efficiently and at scale. Students often struggle to interact effectively with LLMs to obtain meaningful feedback. We introduce an LLM-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) with a structured interface and prompts aligned with Hattie’s feedback model. To provide more focused feedback, we utilize the user interaction history for context. Additionally, we explore the question of proactivity. A user study with 9 participants compared history-based and current-state feedback methods using ChatGPT, showing a preference for history-based feedback in 69% of cases and with higher usefulness ratings (M = 7.57 vs. M = 4.1, p = 0.03 (statistically significant at p < 0.05)). This effect became more pronounced in later learning stages. For proactivity, we collected user data from the study, where participants explicitly requested feedback, and trained a neural network (NN) to predict optimal feedback timing. While the model achieved 97% accuracy on test data, the small sample size (N = 10) and the use of oversampling limit its generalizability. Future work will refine history-based feedback with eye-tracking data and integrate NN-driven proactive behavior to further enhance the effectiveness of LLM-based ITS in programming education. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - AI-enhanced adaptive learning systems, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), improve teaching methods and enhance learning experiences across various domains, especially in technical subjects like mathematics and sciences. They provide personalized and adaptable environments, fostering engagement and academic achievement through tailored educational approaches. Despite the significant advancements in mathematical language processing driven by the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning these expansive models for specialized mathematical tasks poses notable challenges. This is often a consequence of the scarcity of labeled datasets in this domain. To bridge this gap, this study curates a unique dataset, comprising around 4,000 formulas from mathematics, physics, and engineering, which features computationally rearranged equations paired with expert-reviewed, student-friendly explanations. Developed using the SymPy Python library, it serves as a comprehensive resource for evaluating language models in mathematical education. Furthermore, utilizing both the mathematical LaTeX and the string format of equations, this research fine-tunes several LLMs to highlight the differences between the models’ explanation generation capabilities and performance in generating accurate and informative mathematical explanations. Additionally, the comparison between outputs generated using LaTeX and string representations offers insights into the effectiveness of each format in conveying mathematical semantics. This research study contributes to the field of automated mathematics education, providing a deeper understanding of the potential of language models in creating explanations for intelligent tutoring systems.

AB  - In this study, we introduce a Conversational Intelligent Tutoring System designed to create an interactive and immersive learning experience aimed at improving the speaking abilities of second language learners. This system mimics a human tutor by engaging in role-play dialogues with the learner, based on predefined scenarios, and offers corrective feedback on the learners’ utterance, while also engaging in chat to encourage student participation. The tutoring system includes a deep-learning classifier to assess students’ utterances, a dialogue generator customized for responding to students’ free-form chats, and a straightforward dialogue manager to determine the sequence of conversational turns. To tackle the challenge posed by the scarcity of tutoring dialogue resources, a significant hurdle for deep learning methods, we present a cost-effective approach that efficiently extends existing Korean dialogue datasets for the purpose of intelligent language tutoring. We carried out a series of experiments to compare various fine-tuned models based on language models of different sizes, and included a comparative analysis with ChatGPT. We discovered that smaller, specialized, fine-tuned models can either surpass or match the performance of GPT-4 in specific tutoring applications. Given the educational sector’s demand for cost-effective solutions, our contributions, spanning system design, dataset development, and comparative analysis, serve as valuable references to address these needs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are fundamental to modern web development, yet many learners encounter significant challenges with its intricate syntax and extensive styling capabilities. Approximately 85.7% of students report difficulties in mastering CSS concepts, which are often compounded by motivational issues that hinder the learning process. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a web-based educational application designed to enhance CSS learning through the integration of an innovative pedagogical agent that employs advanced scaffolding methods. The application utilizes a dual-phase scaffolding approach, including procedural scaffolding, which offers structured guidance through pre-designed dialogues, and strategic scaffolding, which employs ChatGPT to deliver personalized, adaptive feedback tailored to individual learning needs. The implementation of these scaffolding techniques has led to significant improvements in both user engagement and learning outcomes. Thematic analysis revealed that 80% of participants found the learning style provided by the pedagogical agent aligned with their personal preferences, compared to only 40% with conventional methods. Additionally, 90% of participants experienced increased motivation using the application with the pedagogical agent, versus 40% with the conventional approach. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pedagogical agent in fostering a personalized and engaging learning experience, enhancing both motivation and learning. This research lays the chance for future advancements in interactive and adaptive learning systems, demonstrating the potential of combining pedagogical agents with sophisticated language models like ChatGPT to address educational and motivational challenges.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - High-quality conversational datasets are crucial for the successful development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) backend. Synthetic student-teacher dialogues, generated using advanced GPT-4 models, are a common strategy for creating these datasets. However, subjects like physics that entail complex calculations pose a challenge. While GPT-4 presents impressive language processing capabilities, its limitations in fundamental mathematical reasoning curtail its efficacy for such subjects. To tackle this limitation, we introduce in this paper an innovative stateful prompt design. Our design orchestrates a mock conversation where both student and tutorbot roles are simulated by GPT-4. Each student response triggers an internal monologue, or 'code soliloquy' in the GPT-tutorbot, which assesses whether its subsequent response would necessitate calculations. If a calculation is deemed necessary, it scripts the relevant Python code and uses the Python output to construct a response to the student. Our approach notably enhances the quality of synthetic conversation datasets, especially for subjects that are calculation-intensive. The preliminary Subject Matter Expert evaluations reveal that our Higgs model, a fine-tuned LLaMA model, effectively uses Python for computations, which significantly enhances the accuracy and computational reliability of Higgs' responses. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Notwithstanding the growing advantages of incorporating Augmented Reality (AR) in science education, the pedagogical use of AR combined with Pedagogical Agents (PAs) remains underexplored. Additionally, few studies have examined the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into science education to create GAI-enhanced PAs (GPAs) that enrich the learning experiences. To address these gaps, this study designed and implemented a GPA-enhanced 5E model within AR environments to scaffold students’ science learning. A mixed-methods design was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on students’ academic achievement, cognitive load, and their perceptions of GPAs as learning aids through using the 5E model. Sixty sixth-grade students from two complete classes were randomly assigned to either an experimental group engaged in AR science learning with a GPA-enhanced 5E approach or a control group that followed the traditional 5E method. The findings revealed that the GPA-enhanced 5E approach in AR environments significantly improved students’ academic achievement and decreased cognitive load. Furthermore, students in the experimental group reported positive perceptions of the GPA-enhanced 5E method during the AR science lessons. The findings offer valuable insights for instructional designers and educators who leverage advanced educational technologies to support science learning aligned with constructivist principles. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Personalized e-learning systems have transformed the delivery of educational content, aligning it more closely with individual learners' needs. Among the various approaches to achieving this personalization, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality prediction emerged as a valuable tool for adapting learning content to match individual preferences and learning styles. Despite these advancements, personalized e-learning systems quite struggle with handling large volumes of information, often facing difficulties in balancing prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. To ensure personalization, integrating advanced technologies such as machine learning and deep learning is crucial for creating more sustainable and effective learning environments. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates MBTI personality prediction with a deep learning approach and a Learner Profile ontology (LPO) to enhance the personalization and recommendation process. The proposed method employs the BERT model, a Transformer-based architecture, for personality prediction, combined with an oversampling technique to handle data imbalance. The predicted personality type is incorporated into a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)-based ontology enriched with WordNet, enabling better alignment of learning resources with individual learner traits. Experimental results validate the efficacy of this integrated approach, demonstrating significant improvements in learner satisfaction and educational outcomes.  © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - The Learning Assistant Manager and Builder (LAMB) is an open-source software framework that lets educators build and deploy AI learning assistants within institutional Learning Management Systems (LMS) without coding expertise. It addresses critical challenges in educational AI by providing privacy-focused integration, controlled knowledge bases, and seamless deployment through standard protocols. This paper presents major enhancements that enable systematic quality assurance and continuous improvement of these learning assistants. The new LAMB includes mechanisms for structured feedback on real-world assistant behavior, transforming it into a test suite with curated prompts and expected correct or incorrect responses. When changes are made—such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation optimization, or knowledge base expansions—this suite enables automated validation of their impact. A key innovation is using frontier large language models (LLMs) to evaluate responses automatically, generating detailed reports that reveal improvement areas and confirm performance gains. This systematic feedback-driven testing fosters continuous refinement while preserving quality standards. Validation studies show measurable boosts in reliability and consistency. In various educational contexts, the framework identifies edge cases, maintains consistency across iterations, and provides actionable insights. Automated testing is especially beneficial for assistants with extensive knowledge bases and complex interaction patterns. This work advances educational AI by providing a robust methodology for quality assurance and ongoing improvement of learning assistants. Its structured feedback and automated evaluations ensure alignment with educational goals while refining assistants over time. The enhanced LAMB framework offers a scalable and reliable solution for educators aiming to integrate AI-driven support into their LMS environments. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Intent classification is a foundational element in natural language processing, enabling conversational systems to accurately interpret user intent. In educational contexts, effective intent classification within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) can significantly enhance personalized student interactions. This paper presents the intent classification module for the Learner-Aware AI (LAAI) tutor, a dialogue-based ITS designed to recognize and respond to diverse student behaviors, such as valid answers, questions, expressions of boredom, and requests for clarification. We introduce LAAIIntentD, a custom data set specifically designed for this task, containing 1,244 labeled training records and 278 evaluation records. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) LAAI-intent-classifier using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to create a lightweight yet powerful intent classifier. Our fine-tuned model achieves better overall Recall (0.86), Precision (0.85), and F1-Score (0.83) compared to GPT-based methods. GPT models with CoT and Few-Shot prompting improve Recall but sacrifice F1 scores. This highlights our model’s efficiency in balancing accuracy and scalability for ITS applications. © 2024 IEEE.

This study introduces ActiveAI, a scalable web-based tutoring system aligned with AI4K12’s five big ideas in AI, designed to foster AI literacy among K-12 students through active learning and interaction with intelligent agents. A controlled classroom study involving 171 middle school learners was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ActiveAI in fostering AI literacy skills and competency toward AI. Results showed that, compared to students in the tell-and-practice control condition, students who used ActiveAI exhibited higher post-test performance in the module about how next-word prediction and temperature work in large language models. Students also developed higher self-reported competence toward AI after using ActiveAI than in the control condition. We conclude by suggesting assessment designs that promote deeper engagement with AI concepts by addressing students’ common misconceptions, like “AI thinks just like humans”, in K-12 AI literacy education.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Due to the widespread applicability of generative artificial intelligence, we have seen it adopted across many areas of education, providing universities with new opportunities, particularly in cybersecurity education. With the industry facing a skills shortage, this paper explores the use of generative artificial intelligence in higher cybersecurity education as an intelligent tutoring system to enhance factors leading to positive student outcomes. Despite its success in content generation and assessment within cybersecurity, the field’s multidisciplinary nature presents additional challenges to scalability and generalisability. We propose a solution using agents to orchestrate specialised large language models and to demonstrate its applicability in graduate level cybersecurity topics offered at a leading Australian university. We aim to show a generalisable and scalable solution to diversified educational paradigms, highlighting its relevant features, and a method to evaluate the quality of content as well as the general effectiveness of the intelligent tutoring system on subjective factors aligned with positive student outcomes. We further explore areas for future research in model efficiency, privacy, security, and scalability. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Handwriting Mathematical Expression Recognition has several applications, including the potential to make Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) more accessible to underserved regions. However, young children’s handwriting pose several challenges, even for instructors, calling for advanced approaches to understand their writings. This paper explores the potential of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLM) for recognizing numbers or mathematical expressions handwritten by children by comparing GPT-4V, LLaVA 1.5, and CogVLM on a dataset of 251 images. Results indicate that while pre-trained models offer promise, their performance without fine-tuning or zero-shot learning remains inadequate. Results reveal the challenges of utilizing pre-trained VLMs for recognizing children’s handwriting, particularly in educational settings. Issues such as poor handwriting and partial erasures pose difficulties for existing models, with GPT-4V’s safety system limitations hindering its efficacy. In general, CogVLM presented the best performance. GPT-4V exhibited superior performance in recognizing equations, but still struggles with handwritten content, highlighting the need for model refinement and data policies. This study contributes insights into the potential of existing pre-trained models in educational contexts and demonstrates the importance of, for example, fine-tuning to domain-specific datasets. Continued research is necessary to enhance VLM capabilities for educational support, particularly in children’s handwriting recognition. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student’s error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4’s annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

AB  - RAGMan is an LLM-powered tutoring system that can support a variety of course-specific and homework-specific AI tutors. RAGMan leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as strict instructions, to ensure the alignment of the AI tutors' responses. By using RAGMan's AI tutors, students receive assistance with their specific homework assignments without directly obtaining solutions, while also having the ability to ask general programming-related questions. RAGMan was deployed as an optional resource in an introductory programming course with an enrollment of 455 students. It was configured as a set of five homework-specific AI tutors. This paper describes the interactions the students had with the AI tutors, the students' feedback, and a comparative grade analysis. Overall, about half of the students engaged with the AI tutors, and the vast majority of the interactions were legitimate homework questions. When students posed questions within the intended scope, the AI tutors delivered accurate responses 98% of the time. Among the students who used AI tutors, 78% reported that the tutors helped their learning. Beyond AI tutors' ability to provide valuable suggestions, students reported appreciating them for fostering a safe learning environment free from judgment. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - This paper investigates the implementation of AI-driven feedback in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) developed for training of counselors. By using LLMs, the study explores the automatic generation of feedback for communication-intensive tasks such as online counseling. The evaluation compares different feedback methods, including the sandwich, WWW and STATE methods, and assesses their emotional and objective impact. The results show that AI-generated feedback fulfills objective criteria better than emotional ones. Fine-tuning an open source LLM can improve both the emotional and objective quality of feedback. Furthermore, the study examines the acceptance of AI feedback among aspiring counselors, highlighting the influence of familiarity with AI on acceptance levels. Ethical considerations, including bias and hallucination, are addressed, with recommendations for risk mitigation through multi-feedback options and expert supervision. This research contributes to the understanding of the role of AI in improving digital counseling practices and highlights the need for continuous evaluation and ethical considerations.  © 2024 Polish Information Processing Society.

AB  - This research full paper describes a web-based online learning platform that delivers financial literacy lessons via talking head videos of AI-generated personas with two additional core features: LLM-powered proactive chat-based question-and-answer interactivity, and personal choice of the AI instructor from a list of distinct personas. We conducted two comparative studies with a total of 233 Thai students aged 1825, which aim to 1) investigate the impact of interactivity and instructor selection on the learning experience, and 2) further explore the underlying factors at play with instructor selection by introducing AI instructors' backstories as an extra intervention. We found that enabling interactivity significantly enhanced learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and virtual instructors' humanness compared to the passive setting. Providing learners with a choice of AI instructors provided minimal additional benefit. However, the learner's feeling of relatedness toward the instructor is a significant positive predictor of learning motivation, positive emotion, and agent credibility, while goal alignment with the agent correlates with perceived learning facilitation, and admiration corresponds with perceived agent humanness. These findings underscore the potential of interactive virtual instructors-ones that interactively encourage learners to reflect on the teaching materials throughout the lesson through two-way interaction-in enhancing motivational and experiential aspects of remote education, even if they do not significantly impact comprehension, and the importance of promoting learner's relatedness and goal alignment with the agent in boosting other aspects of the learning experience. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Rapid advances in artificial intelligence are transforming high-stakes fields like medicine and education while raising pressing ethical challenges. This paper introduces the Ethical Firewall Architecture—a comprehensive framework that embeds mathematically provable ethical constraints directly into AI decision-making systems. By integrating formal verification techniques, blockchain-inspired cryptographic immutability, and emotion-like escalation protocols that trigger human oversight when needed, the architecture ensures that every decision is rigorously certified to align with core human values before implementation. The framework also addresses emerging issues, such as biased value systems in large language models and the risks associated with accelerated AI learning. In addition, it highlights the potential societal impacts—including workforce displacement—and advocates for new oversight roles like the Ethical AI Officer. The findings suggest that combining rigorous mathematical safeguards with structured human intervention can deliver AI systems that perform efficiently while upholding transparency, accountability, and trust in critical applications. © 2025 by the author.

AB  - This paper presents LAMB (Learning Assistant Manager and Builder), an innovative open-source software framework designed to create AI-powered Learning Assistants tailored for integration into learning management systems. LAMB addresses critical gaps in existing educational AI solutions by providing a framework specifically designed for the unique requirements of the education sector. It introduces novel features, including a modular architecture for seamless integration of AI assistants into existing LMS platforms and an intuitive interface for educators to create custom AI assistants without coding skills. Unlike existing AI tools in education, LAMB provides a comprehensive framework that addresses privacy concerns, ensures alignment with institutional policies, and promotes using authoritative sources. LAMB leverages the capabilities of large language models and associated generative artificial intelligence technologies to create generative intelligent learning assistants that enhance educational experiences by providing personalized learning support based on clear directions and authoritative fonts of information. Key features of LAMB include its modular architecture, which supports prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and the creation of extensive knowledge bases from diverse educational content, including video sources. The development and deployment of LAMB were iteratively refined using a minimum viable product approach, exemplified by the learning assistant: “Macroeconomics Study Coach,” which effectively integrated lecture transcriptions and other course materials to support student inquiries. Initial validations in various educational settings demonstrate the potential that learning assistants created with LAMB have to enhance teaching methodologies, increase student engagement, and provide personalized learning experiences.

AB  - Estimates predict a global deficit of 4 million software engineers by 2025, further complicated by the software engineering (SE) industry's escalating use of artificial intelligence (AI). To tackle this issue, our research suggests that computer science (CS) curricula in middle and high schools need to be updated to incorporate SE industry segments that significantly employ AI. This strategic curriculum alignment is significant for preparing a workforce equipped to meet future industry demands. Our initial analysis involved reviewing nine international AI education guidelines to evaluate current methods for integrating AI into SE education. The findings indicated a pronounced lack of specific guidance connecting AI applications in the SE industry with educational content. To address this, we performed a systematic literature review of 12 research papers focusing on AI's role across the SE industry, followed by multiple rounds of inductive content analysis. An industry segment was deemed "essential" if it was referenced in 75% or more of the papers' findings. Through this method, we identified 10 essential SE industry segments for inclusion in CS education: software development, software maintenance, process improvement, software economics, knowledge management, project management, software testing, software security, quality assurance, and deployment and operations (DevOps). These findings led to the creation of the AI-USE (Artificial Intelligence Usage in Software Engineering) framework, which maps these 10 key segments to the predominant uses of SE in the industry as identified in the literature. Further inductive content analysis helped us develop subsegments for these essential areas. Ongoing framework development involves refining these subsegments and gathering feedback from industry and academic professionals. We anticipate that the fully developed AI-USE framework will significantly enhance SE education, equipping the next generation of software engineers with the AI proficiency required to address the industry’s evolving demands. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.

AB  - In the era of globalization and information technology, English is becoming more and more important as the main language of international communication, but the traditional English teaching model is difficult to meet the diverse needs of learners due to the uneven distribution of resources and the lack of personalized tutoring. In order to meet these challenges, this study uses a generative pre-training model to build an intelligent tutoring system for English teaching, aiming to innovate the English learning experience with the help of artificial intelligence technology and achieve personalized and efficient teaching guidance. The construction solution includes collecting data such as learners' English proficiency test scores, learning history, and self-reported learning preferences to create detailed learner profiles, integrating advanced generative pre-trained models such as GPT-based and fine-tuning with data related to English language teaching, and then automatically generating exercises based on learner profiles and dynamically adjusting the difficulty. The application of the system is reflected in the integration of natural language processing technology and generative models to provide immediate feedback after learners complete the exercises, such as analyzing the grammar, vocabulary use and coherence of English passages and pointing out mistakes, giving suggestions and explanations for corrections, as well as providing intelligent tutoring in the form of dialogues, such as examples, comparisons and related exercises to enhance understanding in response to learners' questions about grammar points. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional teaching mode, the use of this intelligent tutoring system increases the learners' progress in English listening, speaking, reading and writing by an average of 30 %, and the learning satisfaction increases by 40 %, especially in the improvement of oral expression and writing skills. © 2025

AB  - Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant and popular form of NAI, presents a promising avenue for advancing personalized instruction via neurosymbolic educational agents. By leveraging structured knowledge, these agents can provide individualized learning experiences that align with specific learner preferences and desired learning paths, while also mitigating biases inherent in traditional AI systems. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of KGs, LLMs, and pedagogical agents – embodied characters designed to enhance learning – as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - The emergence of generative AI (GAI) offers students an opportunity to experience learning interaction similar to that with real humans. This technology enables students to communicate with AI in natural language; GAI can also generate content more aligned with students’ needs. Notably, in the context of mobile learning, students will have more opportunities to interact with GAI. Therefore, exploring the role of GAI in the mobile learning environment and the possible combination with learning strategies is an important topic. In this position paper, we discuss this topic from the perspective of academic research and educational objectives. We also discuss the transformation of students’ roles in various educational objectives. Furthermore, this study explores potential research and educational issues, including integrating learning strategies, discussing student learning performance, integrating with other software and hardware, student interaction with GAI, and the issue of the right to learn GAI. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The increasing significance of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries highlights the necessity for industry leaders and professionals to comprehend and gain knowledge about AI. The urgency for AI literacy is more critical than ever due to the potential unethical use of AI resulting from insufficient knowledge. This issue is particularly crucial for educators because they need to understand and adapt to the impact of AI within educational institutions, with some needing to use and become literate in AI, given that students now have increased access to public AI tools. This research presents a multi-phase study to address the issue of bridging the knowledge gap in AI by conducting co-creation with innovation champions, illustrated by a case of Generative AI innovation in a K-12 school. Using action design research, we engaged experienced teachers who are experts in pedagogical innovation to co-create a generative AI-enhanced platform at a leading K-12 education institution known for its pedagogical innovation in Australia. The findings reveal that champions enhance their knowledge through their subject-matter expertise, organizational knowledge, and AI knowledge gained through external exposure and experience. The study also highlights the key elements that facilitate a cross-domain knowledge exchange platform, enabling champions to be exposed to and experience AI technological learning, leading to shifts in their understanding and perception of AI. The initially unaware and sceptical champions become more aware and capable of articulating more technical AI knowledge rooted in a shared value. This research demonstrates how co-creation serves as a pathway for learning AI, particularly among K-12 teachers who are innovation champions. It underscores the impact of experiential and organizational learning on AI collaborative learning and behavioral intentions. Additionally, the study presents that aligning organizational and personal visions and values can influence perceptions about AI technologies, enhancing the discourse on AI and education innovation. © 2024 The Authors
