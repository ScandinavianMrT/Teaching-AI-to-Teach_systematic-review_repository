AB  - The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), including large language models (LLM), has merged to support students in their academic writing process. Keeping pace with the technical and educational landscape requires careful consideration of the opportunities and challenges that GenAI-assisted systems create within education. This serves as a useful and necessary starting point for fully leveraging its potential for learning and teaching. Hence, it is crucial to gather insights from diverse perspectives and use cases from actual users, particularly the unique voices and needs of student-users. Therefore, this study explored and examined students' perceptions and experiences about GenAI-assisted academic writing by conducting in-depth interviews with 20 Chinese students in higher education after completing academic writing tasks using a ChatGPT4-embedded writing system developed by the research team. The study found that students expected AI to serve multiple roles, including multi-tasking writing assistant, virtual tutor, and digital peer to support multifaceted writing processes and performance. Students perceived that GenAI-assisted writing could benefit them in three areas including the writing process, performance, and their affective domain. Meanwhile, they also identified AI-related, student-related, and task-related challenges that were experienced during the GenAI-assisted writing activity. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of GenAI's impact on academic writing that is inclusive of student perspectives, offering implications for educational AI design and instructional design.

T2  - Journal of Educational Technology Systems
AB  - This project explored perceptions of ChatGPT in higher education among students and faculty to assess teaching and learning implications of this Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI)-based novel tool. Two theoretical frameworks inspired the project, including "Diffusion of Innovation theory" (Rogers, 1962) and "Technology Acceptance Model" (Davis, 1989). An online survey was completed by 380 participants (N = 380). Participants indicated that they would not use ChatGPT to plagiarize but believed others would. When asked to rate the accuracy of ChatGPT's output, more than half took the incorrect output as correct/somewhat correct or could not tell whether it was correct or incorrect. Results varied based on participant demographics, including age, gender, and occupation. These findings support the need for data literacy. If Generative AI is to be used in higher education to aid in the learning process, it is imperative to continue teaching critical thinking.

AU  - Asad, Muhammad Mujtaba
AU  - Ajaz, Aqsa
T2  - International Journal of Information and Learning Technology
AB  - Purpose: A gripping keyword emerged in the dynamic world of 2022: GPT or the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), at its forefront, embodied by the mysterious ChatGPT. This technological marvel had been silently lurking in the background for just over five years. However, all of a sudden, it emerged onto the scene, capturing the public's attention and quickly becoming one of the most widely adopted inventions in history. Therefore, this narrative review is conducted in order to explore the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on lifelong learning and upskilling of students in higher education and address opportunities and challenges proposed by Artificial Intelligence from a global perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This review has been conducted using a narrative literature review approach. For in-depth identification of research gaps, 105 relevant articles were included from scholarly databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar. Seven major themes emerged from the literature to answer the targeted research questions that describe the use of AI, the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on students, the challenges and opportunities of using AI in education and mitigating strategies to cope with the challenges associated with the integration of ChatGPT and generative AI in education. Findings: The review of the literature presents that generative AI and ChatGPT have gained a lot of recognition among students and have revolutionized educational settings. The findings suggest that there are some contexts in which adult education research and teaching can benefit from the use of chatbots and generative AI technologies like ChatGPT. The literature does, however, also highlight the necessity of carefully considering the benefits and drawbacks of these technologies in order to prevent restricting or distorting the educational process or endangering academic integrity. In addition, the literature raises ethical questions about data security, privacy and cheating by students or researchers. To these, we add our own ethical concerns about intellectual property, such as the fact that, once we enter ideas or research results into a generative chatbot, we no longer have control over how it is used. Practical implications: This review is helpful for educators and policymakers to design the curriculum and policies that encourage students to use generative AI ethically while taking academic integrity into account. Also, this review article identifies the major gaps that are associated with the impact of AI and ChatGPT on the lifelong learning skills of students. Originality/value: This review of the literature is unique because it explains the challenges and opportunities of using generative AI and ChatGPT, also defining its impact on lifelong learning and upskilling of students.

AU  - Gill, Sukhpal Singh
T2  - IEEE Transactions on Education
AB  - Contributions: In this article, a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based Q&A system has been developed by integrating information retrieval and natural language processing techniques, using course materials as a knowledge base and facilitating real-time student interaction through a chat interface. Background: The rise of advanced AI exemplified by ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, has sparked interest in its application within higher education. AI has the potential to reshape education delivery through chatbots and related tools, improving remote learning and mitigating challenges, such as student isolation and educator administrative burdens. Yet, ChatGPT's practical applications in education remain uncertain, potentially due to its novel and enigmatic nature. Additionally, current e-learning chatbot systems often suffer from development complexity and a lack of input from key stakeholders, leading to developer-focused solutions rather than user-centered ones. Intended Outcomes: In this manuscript, we introduce a practical implementation of AI in education by creating a system called Q-Module-Bot that is accessible for both technical and nontechnical educators to harness e-learning benefits and demystify generative pretraining transformer (GPT). Application Design: The proposed Q-Module-Bot system has utilized pretrained large language models (LLMs) to build a Q&A system that helps students with their queries and supports education delivery using content extracted from a virtual learning environment (VLE). Findings: The prototype and system evaluation confirm the effectiveness of a scalable cross-departmental tool featuring source attribution and real-time responses. While successful in encouraging wider acceptance of GPT use cases in higher education, refinements are needed for full integration into the VLE and expansion to other modules/courses.

AB  - The emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), have recently taken different disciplines by surprise. Very few scholarly papers show the collaborative effort by researchers on the impact of generative AI in higher education (HE) and its implication on HE disciplines and activities. This paper uses citation network analysis by deep searching the different research articles using Scopus databases. A bibliographic analysis tool is used to reveal patterns of application of generative AI chatbots in HE, collaboration of generative AI research, and generative AI in HE among different countries of the world. Furthermore, it investigates the thematic topics that generative AI in HE researchers are studying. Research papers from Scopus databases were sampled. The sampling timeframe is from January 2022 to September 2023. This paper presents the preliminary findings of the work that was conducted for a doctoral thesis in computer science and information technology. The preliminary findings show that Spain, the United States of America (USA), and Australia are countries that collaborate more often on the development of generative AI chatbots. In the study, generative AI chatbots were most likely to cover plagiarism and essay inclusion, but very few covered research for postgraduate enterprises. The study concludes that Chatbots are an important part of teaching technology that should be embraced by higher education.

This technology has seen widespread adoption across various sectors of society and is anticipated to revolutionise the educational landscape, especially in the domain of tertiary education. However, there is a gap in understanding factors influencing university students' behavioural intention to use generative AI, leading to hesitation in its adoption. Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the factors that influence university students' behavioural intention to engage with and utilise generative AI. The study sought to delve into the fundamental reasons and obstacles that university students encounter when contemplating the adoption of this technology for their academic endeavours. Methods: The study used a quantitative research design, utilising a revised version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. Data were collected from a sample of 380 university students in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan in China. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the relationships between the variables of the model, which included performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), learning value, habit and behavioural intention. Results: The analysis revealed that PE and EE have a direct impact on learning value. Additionally, SI and FC were found to directly affect the formation of habit. Among these factors, learning value emerged as the most potent predictor of university students' behavioural intention to use generative AI. Habit also demonstrated a significant, albeit smaller, effect on behavioural intention. Conclusions: The study's findings underscore the importance of learning value in driving the adoption of generative AI among university students. Efforts to enhance the learning value of generative AI could significantly increase its uptake in higher education. Furthermore, the role of habit, while less pronounced, suggests that consistent exposure and use can foster a greater inclination towards generative AI. These insights provide a foundation for targeted interventions aimed at improving the integration and application of generative AI within educational settings. Stakeholders, including educators, policymakers and designers of generative AI, can leverage these findings to create an environment conducive to the adoption and effective use of generative AI in higher education.

AB  - The value of generative AI tools in higher education has received considerable attention. Although there are many proponents of its value as a learning tool, many are concerned with the issues regarding academic integrity and its use by students to compose written assessments. This study evaluates and compares the output of three commonly used generative AI tools, ChatGPT, Bing and Bard. Each AI tool was prompted with an essay question from undergraduate (UG) level 4 (year 1), level 5 (year 2), level 6 (year 3) and postgraduate (PG) level 7 biomedical sciences courses. Anonymised AI generated output was then evaluated by four independent markers, according to specified marking criteria and matched to the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) of UK level descriptors. Percentage scores and ordinal grades were given for each marking criteria across AI generated papers, inter-rater reliability was calculated using Kendall's coefficient of concordance and generative AI performance ranked. Across all UG and PG levels, ChatGPT performed better than Bing or Bard in areas of scientific accuracy, scientific detail and context. All AI tools performed consistently well at PG level compared to UG level, although only ChatGPT consistently met levels of high attainment at all UG levels. ChatGPT and Bing did not provide adequate references, while Bing falsified references. In conclusion, generative AI tools are useful for providing scientific information consistent with the academic standards required of students in written assignments. These findings have broad implications for the design, implementation and grading of written assessments in higher education.

TI  - The Impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on Practices, Policies and Research Direction in Education: A Case of ChatGPT and Midjourney
AU  - Chiu, Thomas K. F.
T2  - Interactive Learning Environments
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have become increasingly accessible and have impacted school education in numerous ways. However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In schools, teachers' perspectives are crucial for making sense of innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives of teachers and leaders. It used four domains -- learning, teaching, assessment, and administration -- as the initial framework suggested in a systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in education.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of using ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), to enhance critical thinking and argumentation skills among undergraduate students studying international relations in a developing nation context. A total of 95 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 48) and a control group (n = 47). The experimental group engaged in debate sessions using ChatGPT, while the control group participated in traditional debate sessions. Pre-test and post-test assessments were conducted to measure the participants' critical thinking and argumentation skills. The results revealed that the use of ChatGPT significantly improved students' understanding of complex concepts, critical thinking, and argumentation skills compared to traditional debate methods. The findings suggest that integrating LLMs into existing educational curricula may be an effective strategy for enhancing students' critical thinking and argumentation skills in resource-constrained settings. However, the challenges and limitations associated with the use of LLMs in developing nations should be carefully considered. The study contributes to the growing body of research on the application of AI-powered tools in education and informs the development of evidence-based practices and policies for integrating LLMs into educational curricula.

AU  - Roman, Fabio
AB  - The spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been recently generating worries among teachers and educators about the validity of assessment when students make use of AI tools to solve tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose mathematical problem solving activities to be carried out with the aid of ChatGPT, showing how problem solving and critical thinking continue to be pivotal in solving mathematical problems, even if this is performed with the aid of AI. After discussing theoretical frameworks on strategies of problem solving and phases of the critical thinking process, we present six problems of combinatorics that we submitted to ChatGPT. We also asked 40 university students to solve the six problems in group with the aid of ChatGPT during an international module on Problem Solving and Critical Thinking and collected the tutors' observations about the activities. Analyzing ChatGPT solutions and tutors' reflections, we show that the proposed activity requires problem solving and critical thinking to be accomplished. The results corroborate the idea that, instead of limiting the use of AI in education, it is possible to integrate it within learning and assessment to achieve the learning goals.

AB  - This study examined pre-service teachers' perspectives on integrating generative AI (GenAI) tools into their own learning and teaching practices. Discussion posts from asynchronous online courses on ChatGPT were analyzed using the Diffusion of Innovations framework to explore awareness, willingness to apply ChatGPT to instruction, and potential benefits, challenges, and concerns about using GenAI in teaching and learning. The course discussions significantly increased pre-service teachers' awareness and foundational knowledge while reducing anxiety towards AI technologies. However, despite exposure to ChatGPT, only a few confirmed intentions to adopt AI tools in their teaching practices, potentially reflecting lingering uncertainties evidenced by emotional responses, such as worry and concern. Professional development in AI literacy can address these uncertainties and enhance teachers' understanding about using GenAI in class. The study offers insights into responsible GenAI adoption in education and how higher education can leverage ChatGPT to enhance pre-service teacher learning.

AB  - The latest development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly ChatGPT, has drawn the attention of educational researchers and practitioners. We have witnessed many innovative uses of ChatGPT in STEM classrooms. However, studies regarding students' perceptions of ChatGPT as a virtual tutoring tool in STEM education are rare. The current study investigated undergraduate students' perceptions of using ChatGPT in a physics class as an assistant tool for addressing physics questions. Specifically, the study examined the accuracy of ChatGPT in answering physics questions, the relationship between students' ChatGPT trust levels and answer accuracy, and the influence of trust on students' perceptions of ChatGPT. Our finding indicates that despite the inaccuracy of GenAI in question answering, most students trust its ability to provide correct answers. Trust in GenAI is also associated with students' perceptions of GenAI. In addition, this study sheds light on students' misconceptions toward GenAI and provides suggestions for future considerations in AI literacy teaching and research.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies have a long history of being used in education for motivating learners and enhancing learning. However, there have also been critiques for a too uncritical and naïve implementation of AI in education (AIED) and the potential misuse of the technology. With the release of the virtual assistant ChatGPT from OpenAI, many educators and stakeholders were both amazed and horrified by the potential consequences for education. One field with a potential high impact of ChatGPT is programming education in Computer Science (CS), where creating assessments has long been a challenging task due to the vast amount of programming solutions and support on the Internet. This now appears to have been made even more challenging with ChatGPT's ability to produce both complex and seemingly novel solutions to programming questions. With the support of data collected from interactions with ChatGPT during the spring semester of 2023, this position paper investigates the potential opportunities and threats of ChatGPT for programming education, guided by the question: What could the potential consequences of ChatGPT be for programming education? This paper applies a methodological approach inspired by analytic autoethnography to investigate, experiment, and understand a novel technology through personal experiences. Through this approach, the authors have documented their interactions with ChatGPT in field diaries during the spring semester of 2023. Topics for the questions have related to content and assessment in higher education programming courses. A total of 6 field diaries, with 82 interactions (1 interaction = 1 question + 1 answer) and additional reflection notes, have been collected and analysed with thematic analysis. The study finds that there are several opportunities and threats of ChatGPT for programming education. Some are to be expected, such as that the quality of the question and the details provided highly impact the quality of the answer. However, other findings were unexpected, such as that ChatGPT appears to be "lying" in some answers and to an extent passes the Turing test, although the intelligence of ChatGPT should be questioned. The conclusion of the study is that ChatGPT have potential for a significant impact on higher education programming courses, and probably on education in general. The technology seems to facilitate both cheating and enhanced learning. What will it be? Cheating or AI-enhanced learning? This will be decided by our actions now since the technology is already here and expanding fast. [Note: The publication year (2023) shown in the citation on the PDF is incorrect.

AB  - The increasing reliance on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) among students and knowledge workers poses significant risks and raises integrity concerns, prompting some institutions to impose bans on its use. With scant research on a guided framework, strategies, and checklists for the utilization of GenAI, we propose a framework based on the expertise acquisition model, information retrieval theory, and deontological ethics theory, emphasizing the need for domain knowledge, query capabilities, and ethical acumen (DEQ). Using a 'thing' ethnography methodology with ChatGPT, we validated our framework, highlighting the importance of these competencies to mitigate risks, including the generation of factually incorrect and plagiarized content. Our findings suggest that while GenAI can drive innovation, its content should be used as a guiding tool to enhance critical thinking and reasoning, ultimately helping knowledge workers and students avoid plagiarism and maintain academic integrity. We discuss this novel framework and provide avenues for extending this study.

T2  - Contemporary Educational Technology
AB  - This study examines the role of ChatGPT as a writing assistant in academia through a systematic literature review of the 30 most relevant articles. Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has become the most debated topic among scholars and is also being used by many users from different fields. Many articles, reviews, blogs, and opinion essays have been published in which the potential role of ChatGPT as a writing assistant is discussed. For this systematic review, 550 articles published six months after ChatGPT's release (December 2022 to May 2023) were collected based on specific keywords, and the final 30 most relevant articles were finalized through PRISMA flowchart. The analyzed literature identifies different opinions and scenarios associated with using ChatGPT as a writing assistant and how to interact with it. Findings show that artificial intelligence (AI) in education is a part of the ongoing development process, and its latest chatbot, ChatGPT is a part of it. Therefore, the education process, particularly academic writing, has both opportunities and challenges in adopting ChatGPT as a writing assistant. The need is to understand its role as an aid and facilitator for both the learners and instructors, as chatbots are relatively beneficial devices to facilitate, create ease and support the academic process. However, academia should revisit and update students' and teachers' training, policies, and assessment ways in writing courses for academic integrity and originality, like plagiarism issues, AI-generated assignments, online/home-based exams, and auto-correction challenges.

T2  - International Journal for Educational Integrity
AB  - The release of ChatGPT in 2022 has generated extensive speculation about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will impact the capacity of institutions for higher learning to achieve their central missions of promoting learning and certifying knowledge. Our main questions were whether people could identify AI-generated text and whether factors such as expertise or confidence would predict this ability. The present research provides empirical data to inform these speculations through an assessment given to a convenience sample of 140 college instructors and 145 college students (Study 1) as well as to ChatGPT itself (Study 2). The assessment was administered in an online survey and included an AI Identification Test which presented pairs of essays: In each case, one was written by a college student during an in-class exam and the other was generated by ChatGPT. Analyses with binomial tests and linear modeling suggested that the AI Identification Test was challenging: On average, instructors were able to guess which one was written by ChatGPT only 70% of the time (compared to 60% for students and 63% for ChatGPT). Neither experience with ChatGPT nor content expertise improved performance. Even people who were confident in their abilities struggled with the test. ChatGPT responses reflected much more confidence than human participants despite performing just as poorly. ChatGPT responses on an AI Attitude Assessment measure were similar to those reported by instructors and students except that ChatGPT rated several AI uses more favorably and indicated substantially more optimism about the positive educational benefits of AI. The findings highlight challenges for scholars and practitioners to consider as they navigate the integration of AI in education.

AB  - With recent public access to large language models via chatbots, the field of language education is seeing unprecedented levels of interest in how AI will affect language learning and teaching. As attention is primarily focused on student misuse of the technology, the potential affordances of generative AI tools may often be overlooked. In this paper we highlight potential affordances of AI generative tools, such as ChatGPT, for creating language learning and teaching materials and assessments. We offer suggestions on crafting prompts as well as provide example prompts and the materials and assessments generated by ChatGPT in response. We also present a framework for evaluation that combines both of Hubbard's (1988) framework for CALL evaluation and The Douglas Fir Group's (2016) transdisciplinary framework that may assist language educators in determining when it is appropriate to leverage generative AI tools. We then briefly illustrate how the framework has been used in our own evaluations. Finally, we suggest language educators consider how the concerns and opinions of using AI-based tools held by individuals and institutions within their own micro, meso, and macro sociocultural levels align or conflict with those of the individuals and institutions of their students' micro, meso, and macro sociocultural levels.

T2  - Psychology Learning and Teaching
AB  - Progress in understanding students' development of psychological literacy is critical. However, generative AI represents an emerging threat to higher education which may dramatically impact on student learning and how this learning transfers to their practice. This research investigated whether ChatGPT responded in ways that demonstrated psychological literacy and whether it matched the responses of subject matter experts (SMEs) on a measure of psychological literacy. We tasked ChatGPT with providing responses to 13 psychology research methods scenarios as well as to rate each of the five response options that were already developed for each scenario by the research team. ChatGPT responded in ways that would typically be regarded as displaying a high level of psychological literacy. The response options which were previously rated by two groups of SMEs were then compared with ratings provided by ChatGPT. The Pearson's correlations were very high (r's = 0.73 and 0.80, respectively), as were the Spearman's rhos (rho's = 0.81 and 0.82, respectively). Kendall's tau were also quite high (tau's = 0.67 and 0.68, respectively). We conclude that ChatGPT may generate responses that match SME psychological literacy in research methods, which could also generalise across multiple domains of psychological literacy.

AU  - ElArabawy, Sara
T2  - British Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - This study delves into the implications of incorporating AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, in higher education contexts. With a primary focus on understanding the acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT among university students, the research utilizes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as the guiding framework. The investigation probes into four crucial constructs of UTAUT--performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions--to understand their impact on the intent and actual use behaviour of students. The study relies on data collected from six universities in two countries and assessed through descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling techniques, and also takes into account participants' gender and study level. The key findings show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence significantly influence behavioural intention. Furthermore, behavioural intention, when considered alongside facilitating conditions, influences actual use behaviour. This research also explores the moderating impact of gender and study level on the relationships among these variables. The results not only augment our comprehension of technology acceptance in the context of AI tools but also provide valuable input for formulating strategies that promote effective incorporation of ChatGPT in higher education. The study underscores the need for effective awareness initiatives, bespoke training programmes, and intuitive tool designs to bolster students' perceptions and foster the wider adoption of AI tools in education.

TI  - Academics' Perceptions of ChatGPT-Generated Written Outputs: A Practical Application of Turing's Imitation Game
AU  - Matthews, Joshua
AU  - Volpe, Catherine Rita
T2  - Australasian Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), is evolving quickly and having a significant impact on the higher education sector. Although the impact of ChatGPT on academic integrity processes is a key concern, little is known about whether academics can reliably recognise texts that have been generated by AI. This qualitative study applies Turing's Imitation Game to investigate 16 education academics' perceptions of two pairs of texts written by either ChatGPT or a human. Pairs of texts, written in response to the same task, were used as the stimulus for interviews that probed academics' perceptions of text authorship and the textual features that were important in their decision-making. Results indicated academics were only able to identify AI-generated texts half of the time, highlighting the sophistication of contemporary generative AI technology. Academics perceived the following categories as important for their decision-making: voice, word usage, structure, task achievement and flow. All five categories of decision-making were variously used to rationalise both accurate and inaccurate decisions about text authorship. The implications of these results are discussed with a particular focus on what strategies can be applied to support academics more effectively as they manage the ongoing challenge of AI in higher education.

TI  - Have Courage to Use Your Own Mind, with or without AI: The Relevance of Kant's Enlightenment to Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence
AU  - Watanabe, Alice
T2  - Electronic Journal of e-Learning
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education is a complex issue that can be discussed from many different perspectives. There is currently a great need for ethical discussions about the use of AI in universities. For example, educational researchers and teachers are already talking a lot about fairness, accountability, transparency, bias, autonomy, agency and inclusion of AI applications, and discussing these in terms of concrete teaching-learning settings. However, less explored are the implications of AI-enhanced teaching and learning in relation to fundamental educational ideals and goals. The article takes this research desideratum as a starting point by relating the use of AI in universities to Kant's reflections on enlightenment. The aim of this article is to theoretically analyse the compatibility of various AI tools with the ideal of maturity on an educational philosophical level and to formulate recommendations for action based on the results. Through a comprehensive literature review, the article analyses the impact of intelligent tutoring systems, ChatGPT and AI-supported research tools on students' maturity and discusses both opportunities and challenges for higher education. The theoretical analysis shows that intelligent tutoring systems and ChatGPT threaten student maturity, while AI-supported research tools can have a positive effect. In addition, the analysis provides several recommendations that can help to minimise the risks of AI applications in terms of student maturity. The educational principle of research-based learning is of particular importance in this context, illustrating how students can learn to use AI tools responsibly and maturely. In this sense, the paper presents a theoretical study that fundamentally reflects on the maturity ofstudentsin the age of AI and thus both encourages teachers in the field of e-teaching to critically reflect on AI-based tools and provides a basis for further empirical research.

AB  - Background: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in Asian universities struggles to integrate Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA) due to large classes and student reluctance. While ChatGPT offers solutions, its conventional use may hinder independent critical thinking. Objectives: This study introduces PA-GPT, using ChatGPT as a "virtual peer" in peer assessments to promote active learning and enhance knowledge, higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), and attitudes--the core of KSA in STEM. Methods: A randomised controlled trial involved 61 first-year engineering students (43 males, 18 females) from a university in Southern Taiwan enrolled in "Network Embedded Systems and Applications." Participants, all with prior ChatGPT experience but no programming background, were purposively sampled. They were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 31) using PA-GPT or the control group (n = 30) using traditional ChatGPT. Over 8 weeks, data were collected using pre- and post-tests: a knowledge construction test (20 items, [alpha] = 0.85); a HOTS scale ([alpha] = 0.78-0.83) measuring critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity; and the S-STEM questionnaire ([alpha] >0.80) assessing attitudes towards STEM subjects and 21st-century learning. ANCOVA analysed the data, controlling for pre-test scores, and Levene's test checked homogeneity of variances. Results and Conclusions: ANCOVA results showed that PA-GPT significantly outperformed traditional ChatGPT in enhancing knowledge construction (F = 9.89, p = 0.002), critical thinking (F = 37.00, p < 0.001), problem-solving (F = 9.40, p = 0.003), creativity (F = 7.22, p = 0.009), and attitudes towards mathematics (F = 25.52, p < 0.001), engineering/technology (F = 16.06, p < 0.001), and 21st-century learning (F = 26.38, p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that PA-GPT effectively addresses challenges in student engagement and HOTS development in STEM education by simulating peer interactions. Peer Assessment with ChatGPT (PA-GPT) promotes active learning and self-reflection, potentially revolutionising AI-assisted education in large class settings. This study provides pioneering evidence for the effectiveness of AI-driven peer assessment in enhancing comprehensive STEM competencies, offering a promising direction for future educational technology integration.

AB  - This systematic review provides unique findings with an up-to-date examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the US to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72%. Similar to the findings of other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the AIEd was intended for 72% of the studies focused on students, 17% instructors, and 11% managers. In answering the overarching question of how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools, such as Chat GPT.

T2  - Brock Education: A Journal of Educational Research and Practice
AB  - Despite existing research on AI applications in education (AIEd), the release of ChatGPT has disrupted the status quo in the educational landscape. Although this technology can personalize learning, decrease teacher workload, and offer access to a wealth of information, concerns around generative AI (GenAI) tools have emerged, including academic integrity, data accuracy, and bias in information. Given research highlights and acknowledging educators' varied levels of awareness and conflicting views toward AIEd, two teacher educators (also authors of this paper) in the Faculty of Education at Brock University facilitated three workshops among different groups of teacher educators. The workshops focused on the emerging nature of GenAI tools, their affordances, and their implications for educators' practices. Adopting a narrative inquiry approach, the authors describe the details of these workshops and present their reflections on the process of preparing for and facilitating them. Implications for teacher education research and practice are also presented and discussed.

T2  - Education and Information Technologies
AB  - The integration of ChatGPT into educational systems underscores the critical importance of reevaluating the relevance of digital literacy skills. This study empirically tested, for the first time, the theoretical premise that the use of ChatGPT could render certain digital skills obsolete by assuming competencies that students were previously required to master. The study aimed to propose an instructional approach that combines a problem-based learning with ChatGPT activity (AIPBL). Subsequently, it sought to quantitatively measure the impact of AIPBL on students' digital literacy competencies, comparing it to a similar PBL assignment devoid of AI technology (PBL) and a control group engaged in lecture-based learning (LBL). In addition, students' experiences with ChatGPT were qualitatively evaluated. The study enrolled 223 healthcare management students, collecting 441 observations through pre-post-tests. Analysis of covariance and thematic analysis of qualitative data were employed. The results revealed that AIPBL led students to utilize fewer digital literacy skills compared to the PBL group, which displayed improvement across all three digital literacy components. Specifically, AIPBL did not significantly enhance participants' perceptions of access and analysis skills, but it did bolster their evaluation skills between pre- and post-tests. Conversely, the LBL group showed no significant differences between their pre- and post-test results. In conjunction with qualitative findings, this study contributes to existing research by affirming the necessity for updated AI literacy skills in education and highlighting the evolving role of literacy skills in the context of AI integration in higher education.

AB  - Software assistants have significantly impacted software development for both practitioners and students, particularly in capstone projects. The effectiveness of these tools varies based on their knowledge sources; assistants with localized domain-specific knowledge may have limitations, while tools, such as ChatGPT, using broad datasets, might offer recommendations that do not always match the specific objectives of a capstone course. Addressing a gap in current educational technology, this article introduces an AI Knowledge Assistant specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools by enhancing the quality and relevance of large language models (LLMs). It achieves this through the innovative integration of contextual knowledge from a local "lessons learned" database tailored to the capstone course. We conducted a study with 150 students using the assistant during their capstone course. Integrated into the Kanban project tracking system, the assistant offered recommendations using different strategies: direct searches in the lessons learned database, direct queries to a generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model, query enrichment with lessons learned before submission to GPT and large language model meta AI (LLaMa) models, and query enhancement with Stack Overflow data before GPT processing. Survey results underscored a strong preference among students for direct LLM queries and those enriched with local repository insights, highlighting the assistant's practical value. Furthermore, our linguistic analysis conclusively demonstrated that texts generated by the LLM closely mirrored the linguistic standards and topical relevance of university course requirements. This alignment not only fosters a deeper understanding of course content but also significantly enhances the material's applicability to real-world scenarios.

TI  - A Worldwide Study on Language Educators' Initial Response to ChatGPT
AU  - Alm, Antonie
AU  - Ohashi, Louise
T2  - Technology in Language Teaching & Learning
AB  - This exploratory study investigated how 367 university language educators from 48 countries/regions responded to ChatGPT in the first 10 weeks after its release. It explored awareness, use, attitudes, and perceived impact through a survey collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Most participants demonstrated moderate awareness, but little teaching application. Around half had used ChatGPT in some way, but only a minority had used it for educational purposes. Interest was high but many concerns were raised, particularly about student misuse. Most teachers felt they were likely to use it for creating teaching resources but were less open to using it for automated feedback and assessment. Perceptions of the impact of ChatGPT were cautiously optimistic, with more positivity from users with first-hand experience. Concerns focused on misuse, while benefits were noted in terms of efficiency. Qualitative data were analysed using an adapted version of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), which revealed that teachers were primarily in the Management and Consequences stages of concern. Only very few had reached the latter stage of Collaboration and none were in the Refocusing stage, suggesting a gradual adoption process, which was expected given the timing of the study. Key implications are that educators need support in developing skills for pedagogical applications of ChatGPT, while critically evaluating appropriate use. More empirical evidence on effective practices is needed. This study provides baseline data on language teachers' initial engagement with ChatGPT, highlighting promising directions but also remaining concerns. Further research can track how responses evolve.

T2  - Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language)
AB  - This study explored the effect of ChatGPT on the speaking self-efficacy level of English as foreign language learners. The research followed the mixed method approach and involved a total of 65 participants who were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group used the ChatGPT for communicative activities, while the control group was engaged in a regular EFL classroom. The data collection procedure included the administration of the EFL speaking selfefficacy scale and an interview with the experimental group as optional participation. The t-test on independent samples showed non-statistically significant differences in speaking self-efficacy levels of the two groups before the intervention. Nevertheless, the covariance (ANCOVA) analysis after ten intervention sessions revealed noteworthy enhancements in speaking self-efficacy among learners in the experimental group. The interviews revealed that engaging with ChatGPT facilitated learners in developing confidence in their conversational skills, managing their stress levels, and deriving pleasure from the learning experience. The results indicated that interactions facilitated by AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, fostered a conducive learning environment for learners, leading to increased confidence in speaking.

AU  - Román-González, Marcos
T2  - International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education
AB  - In recent years, higher education (HE) globally has witnessed extensive adoption of technology, particularly in teaching and research. The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) further accelerates this trend. However, the increasing sophistication of GenAI tools has raised concerns about their potential to automate teaching and research processes. Despite widespread research on GenAI in various fields, there is a lack of multicultural perspectives on its impact and concerns in HE. This study addresses this gap by examining the usage, benefits, and concerns of GenAI in higher education from a multicultural standpoint. We employed an online survey that collected responses from 1217 participants across 76 countries, encompassing a broad range of gender categories, academic disciplines, geographical locations, and cultural orientations. Our findings revealed a high level of awareness and familiarity with GenAI tools among respondents. A significant portion had prior experience and expressed the intention to continue using these tools, primarily for information retrieval and text paraphrasing. The study emphasizes the importance of GenAI integration in higher education, highlighting both its potential benefits and concerns. Notably, there is a strong correlation between cultural dimensions and respondents' views on the benefits and concerns related to GenAI, including its potential as academic dishonesty and the need for ethical guidelines. We, therefore, argued that responsible use of GenAI tools can enhance learning processes, but addressing concerns may require robust policies that are responsive to cultural expectations. We discussed the findings and offered recommendations for researchers, educators, and policymakers, aiming to promote the ethical and effective integration of GenAI tools in higher education.

T2  - Asia Pacific Journal of Education
AB  - This study aims to investigate the public's perceptions regarding the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) in education by analysing comments on YouTube news clips. The study collected public comments from YouTube news clips disseminated by three prominent broadcasters in South Korea between December 2022 and June 2023. Two dimensions of public perceptions were examined: sentiments and prevalent topics. Employing machine learning techniques, we conducted sentiment analysis and topic modelling on the crowdsourced dataset of 18,566 comments from 66 YouTube news clips. The first research question focused on public sentiments towards GenAI and education. Findings reveal a predominance of neutral sentiments. Rather than adopting extreme positions of complete acceptance or rejection, the public displayed an inclination to appreciate the intricate nuances of GenAI's implications. The second research question sought to identify the main topics emerging from public comments on GenAI and education. We identified 11 distinct topics where two topics are directly linked to educational implications: demands for changes in learning and assessment methods, and the use of GenAI in higher education. Based on the key findings, we draw implications that can inform a broader understanding of public sentiment and perspective towards GenAI and education.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Education
AB  - Contributions: An adoption framework to include generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the university curriculum. It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students' learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.

T2  - Studies in Higher Education
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) may be the new-new-norm in a post-pandemic learning environment. There is a growing number of university students using AI like ChatGPT and Bard to support their academic experience. Much of the AI in higher education research to date has focused on academic integrity and matters of authorship; yet, there may be unintended consequences beyond these concerns for students. That is, there may be people who reduce their formal social interactions while using these tools. This study evaluates 387 university students and their relationship to - and with - artificial intelligence large-language model-based tools. Using structural equation modelling, the study finds evidence that while AI chatbots designed for information provision may be associated with student performance, when social support, psychological wellbeing, loneliness, and sense of belonging are considered it has a net negative effect on achievement. This study tests an AI-specific form of social support, and the cost it may pose to student success, wellbeing, and retention. Indeed, while AI chatbot usage may be associated with poorer social outcomes, human-substitution activity that may be occurring when a student chooses to seek support from an AI rather than a human (e.g. a librarian, professor, or student advisor) may pose interesting learning and teaching policy implications. We explore the implications of this from the lens of student success and belonging.

AB  - Purpose: A number of recent artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies, including summarisers, paraphrasers and the cutting-edge chatbots not only have outstanding potentials in modern educational systems but also could lead to a dramatic paradigm shift in the whole education process. This study aims to explore the factors that shape the academic community's desire and intention to use AI conversational chatbot technology, with a particular focus on the leading ChatGPT. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mixed method approach to explore the educators' adoption of chatbots through an empirically validated model. The model, known as the "Educators' Adoption of ChatGPT", was developed by integrating the theoretical foundations of both the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Status Quo Bias (SQB) frameworks, as well as insights gathered from interviews. The relationships within this model were then tested using a quantitative approach. The partial least squares-structural equation modelling method was used to analyse 243 valid survey responses. Findings: The outcomes of the analysis indicated that perceived educators' effort expectancy, educators' autonomous motivation, perceived learners' AI competency, perceived educators' competency, innovative behaviour towards technological agility and perceived students' engagement are significant determinants of educators' intention to use chatbots. In contrast, perceived unfair evaluation of students, perceived students' overreliance and perceived bias/inaccuracies were shown to have significant impacts on the resistance to use the technology, which typically implies a negatively significant influence on the educators' use intention. Interestingly, perceived fraudulent use of ChatGPT was proven insignificant on the resistance to use chatbots. Originality/value: This study makes a significant contribution to the field of educational technology by filling the gap in research on the use and acceptance of AI-enabled assistants in education. It proposes an original, empirically validated model of educator adoption, which identifies the factors that influence educators' willingness to use chatbots in higher education and offers valuable insights for practical implementation.

T2  - Contemporary Educational Technology
AB  - This study explores Saudi undergraduate students' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in academic writing. Despite extensive research on AI in higher education, there is limited focus on academic writing, especially in the Saudi context. A survey of 189 students, proficient in English and enrolled in freshmen academic writing courses, was conducted. The students frequently used ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Google Translate. Exploratory factor analysis identified two factors: "instructional support of AI tools" and "instructional practices of AI tools," explaining 55.302% of the variance. Descriptive analysis revealed strong student agreement on AI tools' benefits, including idea generation, outline preparation, grammar and spell-check improvements, and time-saving. However, concerns about reliability, contextual accuracy, and ethical implications were noted. The study indicates the need for proper training and clear guidelines to make the most of AI in academic writing. The participants, in various responses, indicated how AI helps develop their writing accuracy and come up with new ideas although some participants worry about relying too much on technology. The study recommends that AI tools can be very helpful, but we need to use them thoughtfully to cater to different student experiences and concerns.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Its Potential Impact on the Future of Higher Education
AU  - Bennett, Lorraine

T2  - Athens Journal of Education
AB  - Still rebounding from the impact of the global pandemic, the higher education sector is being challenged even further by the next wave of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. These technologies have the power to generate in a matter of seconds, quality text, images, music and coding responses to questions or prompts entered into an online chat box. Currently, one of the most accessible and popular text generators is OpenAI's ChatGPT which was released in November 2022. Early evaluation indicates that the quality of the responses exceed standard pass rates for comparable university assessments. Even if academic protocols mandate that text cited from AI sources should be acknowledged and referenced as any other source material, the speed, accessibility and high quality of the AI material justifies a rethink of the purpose of higher education and a redesign of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. An initial suggestion being promoted in the sector is that learning outcomes and assessments should move away from a focus on content memorisation and recall, to development of higher order thinking skills such as critical analysis, evaluation, resilience, creativity, problem solving, appraising and mastery of verbal communication and computer literacy. This preliminary paper examines some of the literature to date, which discusses potential risks and threats, as well as the opportunities to enhance learning, embedded in this new wave of emerging AI technologies in higher education.

AB  - Teachers skilled in using generative artificial intelligence (GAI) have advantages in terms of increased productivity and augmented instructional capabilities. Alongside the rapid advancement of GAI, teachers require authentic learning opportunities to build the confidence and expertise necessary for engaging with these technologies creatively and responsibly. This article provides an illustrative case of preparing preservice and in-service teachers with the knowledge, skills, and mindsets to teach and create with GAI. Using a self-study method to investigate professional practices, we analyzed the curriculum, instruction, and assessment in an upper-level undergraduate course in multimedia design and production. Thirty-five teachers engaged in experiential activities focussed on developing artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, alongside a collaborative assignment to co-author an open-access textbook, "Teaching and Creating With Generative Artificial Intelligence." To support equitable and inclusive access to the educational benefits offered by AI, the Student Artificial Intelligence Literacy (SAIL) framework was developed. SAIL facilitates student AI literacy through curriculum engagement and three distinct types of interactions: cognitive, socio-emotional, and instructor-guided. Building on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the issues with technology training for teachers in Canada, five recommendations are offered to facilitate the meaningful integration of AI literacy in teacher education programs.

AB  - Concerns about the role of technology and the quality of student writing in higher education are not new. Historically, writing scholars have been at the forefront of initiatives that scrutinise and integrate new technologies in higher education. This article contends that writing scholars are again uniquely equipped to assist students, teachers in all disciplines, and institutions of higher education in navigating the challenges created by the public availability of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Adopting a dialogical approach, the article brings together six scholars from diverse disciplinary backgrounds within the broad umbrella of writing studies. Through the lens of writing scholarship, this chorus of critical voices illuminates the important questions posed by, and possible responses to, AI in higher education. Although AI complicates key issues in higher education such as academic integrity, assessment, and authorship, writing scholarship provides an essential framework for educators to respond to these challenges. Collectively, these scholars map the history of writing scholars' responses to technological change in higher education and suggest how writing scholars can contribute to the debates and discussions concerning the impact of AI on higher education.

T2  - Research Issues in Contemporary Education
AB  - The release of ChatGPT and other Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools has raised significant and challenging questions around the ethics of artificial intelligence in higher education. The initial concerns regarding AI in higher education centered on academic integrity, and the literature reflects this initial response. However, the multifaceted nature of higher education institutions means that there are many domains that will be ethically impacted by the application and implementation of AI. The purpose of this literature review is to examine these many domains and stakeholders in terms of ethical impact to surface questions, concerns, and concepts that may help practitioners navigate this complex construct of education, technology, and ethics. The literature identifies several implications for practice, including academic integrity, assessment (including the concept of cognicy and the practice of authentic assessment), policies and syllabi, and frameworks, principles, and tools. It concludes with a rumination on how the work of ethics is often accomplished through questions, as well as with the recognition that, at this stage in the evolution of AI, it is difficult to identify black-letter answers. We must be prepared to adapt and evolve even as AI does.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for nearly a century, yet in recent years the rapid advancement and public access to AI applications and algorithms have led to increased attention to the role of AI in higher education. An equally important but overlooked topic is the study of AI teaching and learning in higher education. We wish to examine the overview of the study, pedagogical outcomes, challenges, and limitations through a systematic review process amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and public access to ChatGPT. Twelve articles from 2020 to 2023 focused on AI pedagogy are explored in this systematic literature review. We find in-depth analysis and comparison of work post-COVID and AI teaching and learning era is needed to have a more focused lens on the current state of AI pedagogy. Findings reveal that the use of self-reported surveys in a pre- and post-design form is most prevalent in the reviewed studies. A diverse set of constructs are used to conceptualize AI literacy and their associated metrics and scales of measure are defined based on the work of specific authors rather than a universally accepted framework. There remains work and consensus on what learning objectives, levels of thinking skills, and associated activities lead to the advanced development of AI literacy. An overview of the studies, pedagogical outcomes, and challenges are provided. Further implications of the studies are also shared. The contribution of this work is to open discussions on the overlooked topic of AI teaching and learning in higher education.

T2  - Interactive Learning Environments
AB  - Chatbot research has received growing attention due to the rapid diversification of chatbot technology, as demonstrated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their integration with automatic speech recognition. However, among various chatbot types, speech-recognition chatbots have received limited attention in relevant research reviews, despite their increasing potential for language learning. To fill this gap, 32 empirical studies on speech-recognition chatbots for language learning were reviewed. The following information was reviewed for each study: basic publication information, research focus, location of chatbot use, methodology, group design format, participant information, intervention duration, target language, device type adopted, and chatbot role. An upward trend in research quantity starting in 2020 was identified, which accelerated exponentially in 2022. College students were more likely than other groups to be involved in research, and English as a second or foreign language was the most common target language. Most studies focused on participants' perceptions of chatbots and the degree to which using chatbots helped them develop their speaking or listening proficiency. Methodologically, single-chatbot design using mixed methods was the most common design format, and most studies were conducted for more than one month in laboratory or classroom settings. Conventional mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablet PCs, and smart speakers without a screen, were the most frequently adopted device types. The chatbots' most common role was as conversational partner. A detailed discussion of these results and their implications for future research on speech-recognition chatbots, particularly regarding the use of LLM-powered chatbots, is provided.

T2  - Brock Education: A Journal of Educational Research and Practice
AB  - In postsecondary education institutions, where innovative technologies continually reshape research and pedagogical approaches, the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools presents promising avenues for enhancing student learning experiences. This study assesses the efficacy of integrating GenAI tools, specifically chatbots, to ameliorate learning outcomes and mitigate test anxiety among postsecondary students. Within the context of an introductory psychology course, 40 participants engaged with chatbots as supplementary "study confidantes" for exam preparation and as facilitators for an essay grading task. The results from surveys administered to the participants indicated that most students found the chatbots helpful in aiding comprehension of course materials. Moreover, a substantial proportion of respondents reported an enhanced understanding of how to structure an academic paper because of their essay grading activity. Despite the favourable perception of chatbot assistance with learning course material and fostering insights into structuring scholarly essays, no discernible alterations in the levels of test anxiety among students were observed. Overall, this research underscores the latent potential of chatbots as pedagogical adjuncts, furnishing instructive insights for educators aiming to innovate instructional methodologies and optimize student learning paradigms within the domain of postsecondary education.

AB  - This study investigates the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools within the School of Arts at a private university in Latin America, focusing on student perceptions and emotional reactions. The research addresses two primary questions: how students perceive the integration of AI tools in their educational experience, and how AI-enhanced classes affect students' emotional reactions compared to traditional lecture-based classes. To explore the first question, we constructed the Synthetic Index of Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools (SIUAIT) to measure the perceived effects of AI usage across five dimensions: effectiveness of AI tools, implementation of ChatGPT, student proficiency, instructor proficiency, and advanced student skills. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) validated the SIUAIT, revealing an increase from 58.84 in the first semester to 60.60 in the second semester of 2023, indicating growing acceptance and perceived utility of AI tools in arts education. To address the second question, we employed advanced neuromarketing technologies, including eye tracking and facial expression analysis, to assess emotional reactions in AI-enhanced versus traditional lecture-based classes. The findings showed that AI-enhanced classes elicited more positive emotions, such as joy and surprise, compared to traditional methods. Statistical analyses, including Pearson correlation, Student's t-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test, confirmed the significance of these differences. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of integrating AI in arts education. The study highlights AI's potential to enhance educational experiences and emotional engagement while emphasizing the need for ongoing training and addressing ethical concerns to ensure the effective and equitable use of AI tools.

AB  - This study examined the effect of antecedents of artificial intelligence (AI) on the productivity of academics in higher education. The study was guided by the pragmatic epistemic perspective predicated on the concurrent integrated mixed-method design used with the support of a Google softcopy version of the semi-structured questionnaire (closed and open-ended questions) to collect data from 663 academics from higher educational institutions in Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Mexico, Germany, India, and Uganda. The quantitative data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistical tools while thematic pattern matching was engaged to analyse the qualitative data. The study found that academics hardly use the main AI tools/platforms, and those mainly used for research and teaching-related activities were ChatGPT, OpenAI, and Quillbot. These AI tools were used mostly for general searches for information on course-related concepts, course materials, and plagiarism checks among others. The study further revealed that challenges associated with AI usage influenced the productivity of academics significantly. Finally, the availability of AI tools was found to engender AI usage but does not directly translate into the productivity of academics. The study, therefore, recommended that the management of higher educational institutions espouse policies, and provide timely information and training on the use of AI in higher education. The policies, information, and training provided should specifically address how to adopt different AI tools for specific aspects of teaching tailored and gravitated toward catalysing the productivity of academics.

AB  - Limited studies exist on faculty members or lecturers' perception and behavioural acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) (e.g. ChatGPT) for their students' benefit. Teachers are the decision-makers for students' teaching and classroom activities. In this regard, the study examined lecturers' use of AI-powered tools and the factors that influence the acceptance of AI in teaching and learning in universities. An online survey was conducted using a cross-sectional design, and the results were analysed using SPSS and SmartPLS. The study findings revealed that more than two-thirds (84%) of lecturers are willing to accept AI for their students, while 16% stated non-acceptance of AI for students. Factors such as years of teaching experience, institutional support for AI use, and attitude towards AI proved to be significant predictors of AI acceptance in education. Key factors influencing lecturers' acceptance of AI for their students include perceived pedagogical affordances, organisational policies and incentives, perceived complexity and usability and socio-cultural context. By addressing teacher concerns through supportive policies, user-friendly interfaces, and alignment with pedagogical goals, higher education institutions can create a more fertile ground for AI adoption.

AB  - As intelligent textbooks become more ubiquitous in classrooms and educational settings, the need arises to automatically provide formative feedback to written responses provided by students in response to readings. This study develops models to automatically provide feedback to student summaries written at the end of intelligent textbook sections. The study builds on Botarleanu et al. (2022), who used the Longformer Large Language Model, a transformer Neural Network, to build a summary grading model. Their model explains around 55% of holistic summary score variance when compared to scores assigned by human raters on an analytic rubric. This study uses a principal component analysis to distill scores from the analytic rubric into two principal components -- content and wording. When training the models on the summaries and the sources using these principal components, we explained 79% and 66% of the score variance for content and wording, respectively. The developed models are freely available on HuggingFace and will allow formative feedback to users of intelligent textbooks to assess reading comprehension through summarization in real-time. The models can also be used for other summarization applications in learning systems. [This paper was published in: "AIED 2023, CCIS 1831," edited by N.

TI  - Chinese University Teachers' Engagement with Generative Ai in Different Stages of Foreign Language Teaching: A Qualitative Enquiry through the Prism of ADDIE
AU  - Liu, Xiaohua
AU  - Xiao, Yangyu
T2  - Education and Information Technologies
AB  - The bulk of recent research on generative AI (GenAI) in education mainly focused on its potential pedagogical uses as well as how students actually exploit such tools during learning, while little has been done to systematically investigate how teachers integrate those tools in different parts of their teaching process. To bridge this gap, the present study conducted in-depth interviews with 17 university English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in mainland China, and scrutinized their different phases of teaching for any GenAI involvement. Through the lens of the ADDIE model (i.e., analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation), it was found that GenAI tools were mainly involved in the development stage (e.g., devising teaching activities and developing teaching materials). During the implementation stage, teachers merely introduced GenAI tools to their students, through means such as demonstrations and workshops, indicating a lack of organic integration of those tools into curriculum-based activities. GenAI involvement in the other three stages of instruction was reported to be none to minimal. The participants also shared both positive and negative experiences with GenAI in their EFL instruction. These findings highlight the urgent need for providing stage-specific professional training on how to integrate GenAI into different instructional stages and developing specialized educational GenAI programs that can produce accurate and high-quality outputs. Other implications for incorporating GenAI into education are also discussed.

TI  - How to Deal with AI-Powered Writing Tools in Academic Writing: A Stakeholder Analysis
AU  - Burkhard, Michael
AB  - Due to the advances of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing, new AI-powered writing tools have emerged. They can be used by students among other things for text translation, to improve spelling or to generate new texts. In academic writing, AI-powered writing tools are posing challenges but also opportunities for teaching and learning. It is an open question in which way to sensibly deal with these tools. To address the issue, this paper investigates, what interests different stakeholders (students, lecturers, university administration) pursue in relation to AI-powered writing tools. Building on this, tensions between different stakeholders are identified and (teaching) strategies proposed to deal with these tensions. To discuss the findings in light of recent developments around ChatGPT, semi-structured expert interviews were conducted in April 2023 with five academic writing lecturers at the University of St. Gallen. The results suggest that as writing tools become more and more powerful, the need for strategies to ensure their reasonable and transparent use also increases.

T2  - Australasian Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies in higher education has raised concerns about academic integrity, assessment practices and student learning. Banning or blocking GenAI tools has proven ineffective, and punitive approaches ignore the potential benefits of these technologies. As a result, assessment reform has become a pressing topic in the GenAI era. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study conducted at British University Vietnam exploring the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Assessment Scale (AIAS), a flexible framework for incorporating GenAI into educational assessments. The AIAS consists of five levels, ranging from "no AI" to "full AI," enabling educators to design assessments that focus on areas requiring human input and critical thinking. The pilot study results indicate a significant reduction in academic misconduct cases related to GenAI and enhanced student engagement with GenAI technology. The AIAS facilitated a shift in pedagogical practices, with faculty members incorporating GenAI tools into their modules and students producing innovative multimodal submissions. The findings suggest that the AIAS can support the effective integration of GenAI in higher education, promoting academic integrity while leveraging technology's potential to enhance learning experiences.

AB  - Miscommunication between instructors and students is a significant obstacle to post-secondary learning. Students may skip office hours due to insecurities or scheduling conflicts, which can lead to missed opportunities for questions. To support self-paced learning and encourage creative thinking skills, academic institutions must redefine their approach to education by offering flexible educational pathways that recognize continuous learning. To this end, we developed an AI-augmented intelligent educational assistance framework based on a powerful language model (i.e., GPT-3) that automatically generates course-specific intelligent assistants regardless of discipline or academic level. The virtual intelligent teaching assistant (TA) system, which is at the core of our framework, serves as a voice-enabled helper capable of answering a wide range of course-specific questions, from curriculum to logistics and course policies. By providing students with easy access to this information, the virtual TA can help to improve engagement and reduce barriers to learning. At the same time, it can also help to reduce the logistical workload for instructors and TAs, freeing up their time to focus on other aspects of teaching and supporting students. Its GPT-3-based knowledge discovery component and the generalized system architecture are presented accompanied by a methodical evaluation of the system's accuracy and performance.

TI  - Mind the Gap, Please! Addressing the Mismatch between Teacher Awareness and Student AI Adoption in Language Education within Higher Education
AU  - Alharbi, Wael
T2  - International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching
AB  - This mixed-methods study investigates the mismatch between student use of AI for academic tasks and teacher awareness in Saudi Arabian higher education. Surveys of 78 teachers and 243 students in English for Specific Purposes courses at public and private universities included Likert-scale items and an open-ended question on AI tools' benefits, challenges, and impact on learning and academic integrity. The study reveals a significant gap between teachers' perceptions of students' AI skills and the reality of AI integration, leading to discrepancies in judging student knowledge and assessment authenticity. To address these challenges, the manuscript proposes strategies, including targeted professional development for teachers, swift adoption of best practices for ethical use of generative AI in classrooms, and fostering open dialogue within institutions. This research provides insights to inform teaching practices, curriculum development, and policy-making in higher education's evolving landscape. Future research could benefit from more comprehensive sampling to enhance generalizability.

AU  - Baker, Bernadette

AU  - McDonald, Peter
AU  - Wang, Liang
T2  - Teachers College Record
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have been implemented across all levels of education, with the rapid developments of chatbots and AI language models, like ChatGPT, demonstrating the urgent need to conceptualize the key debates and their implications for a new era of learning and assessment. This adoption occurs in a context where AI is dramatically remapping "the human," the purposes of schooling, and pedagogy. Focus of Study: The paper examines how different formulations of "human" became interwoven with the sliding signifier of "intelligence" through a series of violent exclusions, and how the shifting contour of "intelligence" produces uneven and unjust ontological scales undergirding both education and AI fields. Its purpose is to engage the education research community in dialogue about biases, the nature of ethics, and decision-making concerning AI in education. Research Design: This paper adapts a historical-philosophical method. It traces the effects of colonialism and racialization within humanism's emergence through Sylvia Wynter's historiography of "figure of Man," especially via the invention of "intelligence," which has linked education and computer science. It also investigates themes central to modern education such as justice, equity, and in/exclusion through a philosophical examination of the ontological scales of "human." Conclusions: After outlining how "intelligence" has shifted from reason-as-morality to concepts of natural intelligence, we argue that current examples of AI in Education (AIEd), like classroom chatbots and social agents, constitute an intermediary point in the arc toward a new computational superintelligence--the emergence of man3--illustrating the opportunities, risks, and ethical issues in pedagogical applications based on emotion. We outline three differing visions of AIEd's future, concluding with a series of provocations (onto-epistemological, practice-based, and purposes of schooling) that exceed such models and that, given rapid innovations in machine learning, require urgent consideration from multiple stakeholders.

TI  - Model of AI Acceptance in Higher Education: Arguing Teaching Staff and Students Perspectives
AU  - Hazaimeh, Manar

T2  - International Journal of Information and Learning Technology
AB  - Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) is constantly evolving and is poised to significantly transform the world, affecting nearly every sector and aspect of society. As AI continues to evolve, it is expected to create a more dynamic, efficient and personalized education system, supporting lifelong learning and adapting to the needs and pace of each student. In this research, we focus on testing the model of AI acceptance in higher education (HE) through human interaction-based factors including attitudes, competencies and openness to experience. Perceived benefits were our expectation to enhance AI acceptance in HE. Design/methodology/approach: To test the model, we collected data from Arab HE institutions by spreading an online questionnaire. The sample consisted of 1,152 of teaching staff and students in Arab region, which were selected randomly. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to determine the interrelated dependence of relationships among variables. Furthermore, processing analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability and validity of questionnaires, multicollinearity and factor loading, in which the items were tested one more time to ensure their validity after translation into Arab language. Findings: Results reveal that adopted attitude, digital competency and openness to experience have positive and significant relationship with both perceived benefits and AI acceptance in HE in the Arab region. The results also demonstrate the indirect impact of digital factors on AI acceptance in existence of perceived benefits, which was important in the validation of the model. Originality/value: The research contributes to AI acceptance theory and research by providing evidence of AI acceptance in the Arab region. As generative AI applications continue to expand and change, the way we accept and interact with them will be different. This model could be adopted by authorities to facilitate the acceptance of AI in Arab HE institutions.

T2  - International Journal of Information and Learning Technology
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify the antecedents that have enabled the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE) institutions at both a macro and micro level. The term adoption is in reference to the diffusion of technology that is actively chosen for use by the targeted demographic. Within the context of this paper, adoption is largely referring to the factors that influence the acceptance and use of AI as a tool for personalized learning. Design/methodology/approach: To develop our understanding and appreciation of the valuable impact that AI potentially has upon personalized learning the following systematic literature review was conducted. An acceptable systematic literature review is a comprehensive method of fully analysing and evaluating all available research in the chosen area or specific research query. Findings: The findings from this study have particular implications for personalized learning in the adoption and diffusion of AI and an increasing integration of macro, structural, and micro, individual. Developing and managing AI in education is seen, from the literature, to becoming more embedded in the teaching and learning process. The paper identifies the following: antecedents that supports the adoption of AI for personalized learning; application of AI technologies in the teaching and learning process; AI technologies that enable personalized instruction and learning; generative AI that supports intuitive learning through tracking data. Originality/value: Personalized learning remains focused on customizable "choice-driven" learning and education. In addition, personalized learning and instruction is defined as being a responsive and structured method that adapts to each individual learner's method of learning so that all may achieve their capabilities and actively participate. This solidifies the intrinsic connection between teaching and learning through personalized technologies such as AI.

TI  - A Critical Review of GenAI Policies in Higher Education Assessment: A Call to Reconsider the "Originality" of Students' Work
AU  - Luo, Jiahui
T2  - Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education
AB  - This study offers a critical examination of university policies developed to address recent challenges presented by generative AI (GenAI) to higher education assessment. Drawing on Bacchi's 'What's the problem represented to be' (WPR) framework, we analysed the GenAI policies of 20 world-leading universities to explore what are considered problems in this AI-mediated assessment landscape and how these problems are represented in policies. Although miscellaneous GenAI-related problems were mentioned in these policies (e.g. reliability of AI-generated outputs, equal access to GenAI), the primary problem represented is that students may not submit original work for assessment. In the current framing, GenAI is often viewed as a type of external assistance separate from the student's independent efforts and intellectual contribution, thereby undermining the originality of their work. We argue that such problem representation fails to acknowledge how the rise of GenAI further complicates the process of producing original work and what it means by originality in a time when knowledge production becomes increasingly distributed, collaborative and mediated by technology. Therefore, a critical silence in higher education policies concerns the evolving notion of originality in the digital age and a more inclusive approach to address the originality of students' work is required.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to online assessment, prompting debates over validity, security, and increasingly the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, especially generative AI, on traditional examination methods. This paper explores perceptions of the evolving landscape of online assessment and the role of AI within higher education, building on work conducted at the University of London and the Open University UK. Workshops used speculative methods to envision potential future scenarios and gather perspectives. These revealed a complex, ambivalent outlook on online assessment and AI's role in education. The paper highlights the polarised views surrounding AI, ranging from ethical concerns about academic integrity and unfair advantages to opportunities for enhancing learning and inclusivity in assessment practices. Our findings reflect attitudes of students and educators towards AI and online assessment, identifying key themes such as ethics and integrity, the need for redesigning assessments, issues of diversity and inclusion, and the dependencies required for successful integration of AI. Participants highlighted both the potential benefits of AI in creating more authentic and personalised assessment experiences and the risks of exacerbating inequalities and undermining institutional credibility. The paper underscores the urgent need for a balanced approach to AI and online assessment in educational policy and practice, emphasising inclusive, ethical, and innovative approaches to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these technological disruptors.

However, despite the advances in Natural Language Processing techniques, mLearning still does not take full advantage of the great potential of the latter techniques. It is the case of the transformer language models distributed in chatbot form. Accordingly, this work presents a mLearning application based on OpenAI GPT-3 model, which enables user-friendly interactions. The proposed system was tested in two evaluation scenarios, and the experimental results endorse its appropriateness toward learning experience enhancement. [For the full proceedings, see ED639391.]

AB  - As generative AI (GenAI) policies in higher education in Thailand have been introduced, inquiries regarding GenAI integration and adoption in teaching and learning have been raised. Delving into a relatively unexplored interdisciplinary area in this context, this study aimed to investigate students' responses towards the use of GenAI in academic and professional public relations (PR) writing, employing the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) frameworks. This qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured focus group sessions among native Thai PR major university students, with a workshop on GenAI prior to the discussion on its adoption. The findings revealed that all participants were aware of GenAI and most had utilized it for daily and academic purposes, but never in professional PR writing. Despite having positive attitudes towards its use after the trial, they recognized certain drawbacks and concerns and expressed some reservations towards adopting GenAI in their future academic and professional PR writing, rather in English than in Thai. Besides knowledge and perceptions, individual characteristics were also attributed to hindering GenAI adoption among some participants. Therefore, providing adequate resources and practical guidelines on appropriate GenAI use are crucial. Future research in other subject areas and languages is suggested.

T2  - Studies in Higher Education
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly influenced higher education, notably in academic writing where AI-powered assisting tools offer both opportunities and challenges. Recently, the rapid growth of generative AI (GAI) has brought its impacts into sharper focus, yet the dynamics of its utilisation in academic writing remain largely unexplored. This paper focuses on examining the nature of human-AI interactions in academic writing, specifically investigating the strategies doctoral students employ when collaborating with a GAI-powered assisting tool. This study involves 626 recorded activities on how ten doctoral students interact with GAI-powered assisting tool during academic writing. AI-driven learning analytics approach was adopted for three layered analyses: (1) data pre-processing and analysis with quantitative content analysis; (2) sequence analysis with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and hierarchical sequence clustering; and (3) pattern analysis with process mining. Findings indicate that doctoral students engaging in iterative, highly interactive processes with the GAI-powered assisting tool generally achieve better performance in the writing task. In contrast, those who use GAI merely as a supplementary information source, maintaining a linear writing approach, tend to get lower writing performance. This study points to the need for further investigations into human-AI collaboration in learning in higher education, with implications for tailored educational strategies and solutions.
