AB  - There is growing recognition of the need to teach artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) at the school level. This push acknowledges the meteoric growth in the range and diversity of applications of ML in all industries and everyday consumer products, with Large Language Models (LLMs) being only the latest and most compelling example yet. Efforts to bring AI, especially ML education to school learners are being propelled by substantial industry interest, research efforts, as well as technological developments that make sophisticated ML tools readily available to learners of all ages. These early efforts span a variety of learning goals captured by the AI4K12 "big ideas" framework and employ a plurality of pedagogies.This paper provides a sense for the current state of the field, shares lessons learned from early K-12 AI education as well as CS education efforts that can be leveraged, highlights issues that must be addressed in designing for teaching AI in K-12, and provides guidance for future K-12 AI education efforts and tackle what to many feels like "the next new thing".

AB  - Despite the critical role teachers play in AI education, research on their understanding of generative AI tools remains limited, particularly concerning their ethical assessment knowledge. This study addresses the gap by proposing the Generative AI Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (GenAI-TPACK) framework, which incorporates ethical knowledge as an essential component of university teachers' professional development. Grounded in the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, we utilize structural equation modeling to investigate the interrelationships among Generative AI Technological Knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and ethical assessment knowledge. Our findings indicate that university teachers' effective use of generative AI is contingent upon their technological knowledge and engagement with these tools. Furthermore, while technical knowledge supports evaluative decision-making, it is insufficient on its own for successful integration into teaching practices. Instead, a holistic approach that combines technological and pedagogical knowledge enhances teachers' capacities to utilize generative AI effectively. The study also reveals a positive correlation between ethical assessment knowledge and both pedagogical and content knowledge, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the GenAI-TPACK framework. This research underscores the importance of integrating ethical considerations into AI education, offering valuable insights for the professional development of educators and the enhancement of teacher training programs.

AB  - Recent advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) were accompanied by both hype and fear regarding the ways in which such technologies of automation would replace human labor in various fields, including education. Rather than focusing on the replacement of humans in teaching, this piece uses new materialist thought [Barad, Karen. 2007. Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.] to consider how a new subjectivity, the centaur, might offer a different orientation toward GenAI technologies as tools that possess potentiality for new becomings in teaching. This theoretical piece looks at three AI education (AIED) platforms as a means of diagnosing how current models of AI tools attempt to design for teacher-centaurs by ushering in a more productive teacher workforce. The article also offers an alternative perspective of what might be considered centaur teaching practices, entangling humans and AI in ways that imagine how human-technical relations might be otherwise.

AB  - The broad approach to using Generative AI in K-12 schooling focuses on identifying risks and productivity gains rather than the more complex issues of transformational change. As a response, this study examined how school leaders considered Gen AI transformation within their disciplines. Ten subject leaders were interviewed about their pedagogical beliefs for Gen AI. A belief framework underpinned this study to examine more deeply teachers' multidimensional belief systems that direct transformative Gen AI practices in their classroom. The findings indicate that subversive beliefs about Gen AI limit and influence classroom practice; productivity had little influence on pedagogical roles for Gen AI; and each teacher evidenced a different belief system that represented inter-relationships between risk, productivity and transformation which informed discipline-specific classroom Gen AI approaches. This study contributes teachers' pedagogical belief systems for Gen AI use and pedagogical approaches to Gen AI on a continuum towards transformative practice.

AB  - As we witness groundbreaking advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is clear that the next generation must be equipped with AI literacy: the skill to interact, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems. This study introduces ActiveAI, a scalable web-based tutoring system aligned with AI4K12's five big ideas in AI, designed to foster AI literacy among K-12 students through active learning and interaction with intelligent agents. A controlled classroom study involving 171 middle school learners was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ActiveAI in fostering AI literacy skills and competency toward AI. Results showed that, compared to students in the tell-and-practice control condition, students who used ActiveAI exhibited higher post-test performance in the module about how next-word prediction and temperature work in large language models. Students also developed higher self-reported competence toward AI after using ActiveAI than in the control condition. We conclude by suggesting assessment designs that promote deeper engagement with AI concepts by addressing students' common misconceptions, like "AI thinks just like humans", in K-12 AI literacy education.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have become increasingly accessible and have impacted school education in numerous ways. However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In schools, teachers' perspectives are crucial for making sense of innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives of teachers and leaders. It used four domains - learning, teaching, assessment, and administration - as the initial framework suggested in a systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in education.

AB  - Background: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the need to equip young students with basic AI-related knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10-12. Aims: This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment. Sample: One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72). Methods: Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance. Results: The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety. Conclusions: The DCP approach significantly improved students' learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy. This study highlights the pedagogical value of human-AI comparisons in teaching AI, while contributing to a research agenda on the cognitive and conceptual aspects of AI education.

AB  - Today, Artifcial Intelligence (AI) is prevalent in everyday life, with emerging technologies like AI companions, autonomous vehicles, and AI art tools poised to signifcantly transform the future. The development of AI curricula that shows people how AI works and what they can do with it is a powerful way to prepare everyone, and especially young learners, for an increasingly AI-driven world. Educators often employ robotic toolkits in the classroom to boost engagement and learning. However, these platforms are generally unsuitable for young learners and learners without programming expertise. Moreover, these platforms often serve as either programmable artifacts or pedagogical agents, rarely capitalizing on the opportunity to support students in both capacities. We designed Doodlebot, a mobile social robot for hands-on AI education to address these gaps. Doodlebot is an efective tool for exploring AI with grade school (K-12) students, promoting their understanding of AI concepts such as perception, representation, reasoning and generation. We begin by elaborating Doodlebot's design, high-lighting its reliability, user-friendliness, and versatility. Then, we demonstrate Doodlebot's versatility through example curricula about AI character design, autonomous robotics, and generative AI accessible to young learners. Finally, we share the results of a preliminary user study with elementary school youth where we found that the physical Doodlebot platform was as efective and user-friendly as the virtual version. This work ofers insights into designing interactive educational robots that can inform future AI curricula and tools.

AB  - PurposeIn 2022 generative AI took the Internet world by storm. Free access to tools that can generate text and images that pass for human creations triggered fiery debates about the potential uses and misuses of generative AI in education. There has risen a need to check the popular utopian and dystopian narratives about AI against the diversity of hopes, concerns and future imaginaries that educators themselves associate with generative AI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perspectives of Finnish teacher educators on the use of AI in education.Design/methodology/approachThis article reports findings from a hands-on workshop in teacher training, where participants learned about how generative AI works, collaboratively explored generative AI and then reflected on its potential and challenges.FindingsThe results reveal nuanced, calm and thoughtful imaginaries rooted in deep understanding of educational policy, evaluation and the sociocultural context of education. The results cover teachers' views on the impact of AI on learners' agency, metacognition, self-regulation and more.Originality/valueThis article offers a unique exploration into the perceptions and imaginaries of educators regarding generative AI in specific (instead of "monolithic AI"), moving beyond dystopian views and instead focusing on the potential of AI to align with existing pedagogical practices. The educators contrasted the common techno-deterministic narratives and perceived AI as an avenue to support formative assessment practices and development of metacognition, self-regulation, responsibility and well-being. The novel insights also include the need for AI education that critically incorporates social and ethical viewpoints and fosters visions for a future with culturally, socially and environmentally sustainable AI.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and its increasing societal impacts have turned many computing educators' focus toward early education in machine learning (ML). Limited options for educational tools for teaching novice learners about the mechanisms of ML and data-driven systems presents a recognized challenge in K-12 computing education. In response, we introduce "GenAI Teachable Machine," a visual, data-driven design platform aimed at introducing novice learners to fundamental ML concepts and workflows, particularly in the context of classifiers. Following the design science research (DSR) method, this study presents the prior recommendations, standards, codevelopment, and extensive field testing that resulted in a platform enabling young learners to express their own interest-driven ideas through codesigning and sharing personally meaningful apps. The platform improves on the design of Google's popular Teachable Machine 2 by its ability to create a standalone app by defining one or more actions to be triggered by each classifier result, and deploy that app to other devices. It also enables one to distribute the collection of training data among many users. In addition to the DSR process, this article presents findings from usability lab tests (N = 8) and 6-h classroom projects involving fourth and seventh grade children (N = 213). The results show that children who had no experience of ML were able to navigate through the workflow and turn their own ideas into concrete ML-based apps. The majority of children were able to reflect and present, in their own words, their working process using data-driven (design) thinking concepts and insights.

AB  - This study explores the impact of ChatGPT, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM), as a virtual tutor in online education across five key dimensions: answering questions, writing assistance, study resources, exam preparation, and availability. Utilizing an experimental design, 68 undergraduate students from a public university interacted with ChatGPT over a 15-week academic semester. Data were collected through a validated questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple regression. Findings reveal that students generally perceive ChatGPT as a valuable tool, with a high mean rating across dimensions such as exam preparation (M = 3.38, SD = 1.26) and availability (M = 3.55, SD = 1.34). The correlation analyses showed significant interdependencies between dimensions, with the highest correlation coefficient observed between writing assistance and exam preparation (Kendall's tau_b = 0.45, p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis identified writing assistance (beta = 0.35, p < 0.01) and exam preparation (beta = 0.40, p < 0.01) as significant predictors of overall effectiveness. These findings suggest that ChatGPT's multiple functionalities do not operate independently but instead complement and reinforce each other, resulting in a more supportive and integrated learning environment. The study's findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs to address the limitations of traditional Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and offer a more comprehensive and personalized approach to online learning support. The study, however, identifies key areas for enhancing the LLM-based learning environment including the need for greater contextual engagement in learning materials and more comprehensive and personalized feedback mechanisms. The implications of these findings and future research directions are further discussed.

AB  - A growing number of students in higher education are using ChatGPT for various educational purposes, ranging from seeking information to writing essays. Although many universities have officially banned the use of ChatGPT because of its potential harm and unintended consequences, it is still important to uncover how students leverage ChatGPT for learning, what challenges emerge, and how we can make better use of ChatGPT in higher education. Thus, we conducted focus group workshops and a series of participatory design sessions with thirty students who have actively interacted with ChatGPT for one semester in university and with other five stakeholders (e.g., professors, AI experts). Based on these, this paper identifies real opportunities and challenges of utilizing and designing ChatGPT for higher education.

AB  - Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant and popular form of NAI, presents a promising avenue for advancing personalized instruction via neurosymbolic educational agents. By leveraging structured knowledge, these agents can provide individualized learning experiences that align with specific learner preferences and desired learning paths, while also mitigating biases inherent in traditional AI systems. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of KGs, LLMs, and pedagogical agents - embodied characters designed to enhance learning - as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.

With rapid advancements in AI technology, there is an increasing effort to integrate AI and Educational Technology (EdTech) into educational practices, resulting in AI EdTech. Higher education institutions, particularly universities, are focused on leveraging AI EdTech to augment traditional teaching roles. Traditional educational methods often face limitations in providing personalized learning experiences, whereas AI EdTech offers promising solutions to enhance these methods and provide immersive learning opportunities for students. Currently, various universities independently pursue the implementation of AI EdTech. However, for AI EdTech to be successfully established and widely adopted in higher education, key factors such as maintenance costs and the potential for continuous development should be considered. Therefore, the standardization and development of AI EdTech systems that can be universally applied across universities are essential. In this regard, this study defines the core roles of professors and proposes developmental levels for AI professors to complement these roles. It also outlines the necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each level of AI professor development. These initiatives are expected to play a crucial role in the future standardization and research development of AI EdTech systems.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have found several use cases in education, ranging from automatic question generation to essay evaluation. We explore the potential of using LLMs to author Intelligent Tutoring Systems. A common pitfall of using LLMs as tutors is their straying from desired pedagogical strategies such as leaking the answer to the student and providing no guarantees on the validity or appropriateness of the tutor assistance. While LLMs with certain guardrails can take the place of subject experts, the overall pedagogical design still needs to be handcrafted for the best learning results. Based on this principle, we create a sample end-to-end tutoring system named MWPTutor, which uses LLMs to fill in the state space of a pre-defined finite state transducer. This approach retains the structure and the pedagogy of traditional tutoring systems that has been developed over the years by learning scientists but brings in additional flexibility of LLM-based approaches. Through a human evaluation study on two datasets with math word problems, we show that our hybrid approach achieves a better overall tutoring score than an instructed, but otherwise free-form, GPT-4. MWPTutor is completely modular and opens up the scope for the community to improve its performance by refining its individual modules or using different teaching strategies that it can follow.

AB  - Large language models like ChatGPT can learn in-context (ICL) from examples. Studies showed that, due to ICL, ChatGPT achieves impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses ChatGPT's effectiveness in annotating a dataset for training instructor models in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). The task of an ITS instructor model is to automatically provide effective tutoring instruction given a student's state, mimicking human instructors. These models are typically implemented as hardcoded rules, requiring expertise, and limiting their ability to generalize and personalize instructions. These problems could be mitigated by utilizing machine learning (ML). However, developing ML models requires a large dataset of student states annotated by corresponding tutoring instructions. Using human experts to annotate such a dataset is expensive, time-consuming, and requires pedagogical expertise. Thus, this study explores ChatGPT's potential to act as a pedagogy expert annotator. Using prompt engineering, we created a list of instructions a tutor could recommend to a student. We manually filtered this list and instructed ChatGPT to select the appropriate instruction from the list for the given student's state. We manually analyzed ChatGPT's responses that could be considered incorrectly annotated. Our results indicate that using ChatGPT as an annotator is an effective alternative to human experts. The contributions of our work are (1) a novel dataset annotation methodology for the ITS, (2) a publicly available dataset of student states annotated with tutoring instructions, and (3) a list of possible tutoring instructions.

AB  - Providing personalized assistance at scale is a long-standing challenge for computing educators, but a new generation of tools powered by large language models (LLMs) offers immense promise. Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about howstudents will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students' use of an innovative LLMpowered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course (.. = 52), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that imitate human tutors and aim to provide immediate and customized instructions or feedback to learners have shown their effectiveness in education. With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) further entitle the systems to complex and coherent conversational interactions. These systems would be of great help in language education as it involves developing skills in communication, which, however, drew relatively less attention. Additionally, due to the complicated cognitive development at younger ages, more endeavors are needed for practical uses. Scaffolding refers to a teaching technique where teachers provide support and guidance to students for learning and developing new concepts or skills. It is an effective way to support diverse learning needs, goals, processes, and outcomes. In this work, we investigate how pedagogical instructions facilitate the scaffolding in ITSs, by conducting a case study on guiding children to describe images for language learning. We construct different types of scaffolding tutoring systems grounded in four fundamental learning theories: knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, dialogic teaching, and zone of proximal development. For qualitative and quantitative analyses, we build and refine a seven-dimension rubric to evaluate the scaffolding process. In our experiment on GPT-4V, we observe that LLMs demonstrate strong potential to follow pedagogical instructions and achieve self-paced learning in different student groups. Moreover, we extend our evaluation framework from a manual to an automated approach, paving the way to benchmark various conversational tutoring systems.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost-efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS, however, are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagogical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions. Through post-hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions, we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts), which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two-step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response, we implemented two CITS models using GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.

AB  - The lengthy monologue-style online lectures cause learners to lose engagement easily. Designing lectures in a "vicarious dialogue" format can foster learners' cognitive activities more than monologuestyle. However, designing online lectures in a dialogue style catered to the diverse needs of learners is laborious for instructors. We conducted a design workshop with eight educational experts and seven instructors to present key guidelines and the potential use of large language models (LLM) to transform a monologue lecture script into pedagogically meaningful dialogue. Applying these design guidelines, we created VIVID which allows instructors to collaborate with LLMs to design, evaluate, and modify pedagogical dialogues. In a within-subjects study with instructors (N=12), we show that VIVID helped instructors select and revise dialogues efciently, thereby supporting the authoring of quality dialogues. Our fndings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to assist instructors with creating high-quality educational dialogues across various learning stages.

AB  - Timely, personalized feedback is essential for students learning programming. LLM-powered tools like ChatGPT offer instant support, but reveal direct answers with code, which may hinder deep conceptual engagement. We developed CodeAid, an LLM-powered programming assistant delivering helpful, technically correct responses, without revealing code solutions. CodeAid answers conceptual questions, generates pseudo-code with line-by-line explanations, and annotates student's incorrect code with fix suggestions. We deployed CodeAid in a programming class of 700 students for a 12-week semester. A thematic analysis of 8,000 usages of CodeAid was performed, further enriched by weekly surveys, and 22 student interviews. We then interviewed eight programming educators to gain further insights. Our findings reveal four design considerations for future educational AI assistants: D1) exploiting AI's unique benefits; D2) simplifying query formulation while promoting cognitive engagement; D3) avoiding direct responses while encouraging motivated learning; and D4) maintaining transparency and control for students to asses and steer AI responses.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are currently designed and tested in many fields to improve humans' ability to make decisions. One of these fields is higher education. For example, AI-based chatbots ("conversational pedagogical agents") could engage in conversations with students in order to provide timely feedback and responses to questions while the learning process is taking place and to collect data to personalize the delivery of course materials. However, many existent tools are able to perform tasks that human professionals (educators, tutors, professors) could perform, just in a timelier manner. While discussing the possible implementation of AI-based tools in our university's educational programs, we reviewed the current literature and identified a number of capabilities that future AI solutions may feature, in order to improve higher education processes, with a focus on distance higher education. Specifically, we suggest that innovative tools could influence the methodologies by which students approach learning; facilitate connections and information attainment beyond course materials; support the communication with the professor; and, draw from motivation theories to foster learning engagement, in a personalized manner. Future research should explore high-level opportunities represented by AI for higher education, including their effects on learning outcomes and the quality of the learning experience as a whole.

AB  - Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student's error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4's annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

AB  - Amalgamating generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), Bloom's taxonomy and critical thinking present a promising avenue to revolutionize assessment pedagogy and foster higher-order cognitive skills needed for learning autonomy in the domain of self-directed learning. Gen AI, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a frontrunner in creative tasks, revolutionizing various domains such as art, music, writing and design and showcasing its ability to generate original content across various domains, including education. Incorporating social, cultural, economic and pedagogical dimensions, AI in education encompasses the incorporation of AI technologies like intelligent tutoring systems, chatbots, robots, learning analytics dashboards, adaptive learning systems and automated assessment to bolster and elevate the educational process. The significance of the impact on the creativity component of Krathwohl's revised Bloom's taxonomy arises from the utilization of Gen AI in creative tasks, which prompts concerns regarding the authenticity and originality of AI-generated content. This conceptual research study seeks to investigate the affordances of this amalgamation and aims to reframe the higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy to enhance critical thinking and self-directed learning among students. This study grounds the reader in the existing literature and sets a course for where research in this field should be heading, thus adding value, rather than only providing an overview of the literature. The overall aim of this research was to explore the affordances of the amalgamation of AI, Bloom's taxonomy and critical thinking to support assessment pedagogy for self-directed learning. This paper identifies the gap in the current literature about reconceptualizing assessment pedagogy for developing higher-order thinking skills in a Gen AI higher education landscape. This paper presents a case of revisiting Bloom's taxonomy, advocating the importance of AI fluency and assessment literacy for the development of critical thinking skills and self-directed learning.

AB  - Peer influence plays a crucial role in promoting classroom participation, where behaviors from active students can contribute to a collective classroom learning experience. However, the presence of these active students depends on several conditions and is not consistently available across all circumstances. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT have demonstrated the ability to simulate diverse human behaviors convincingly due to their capacity to generate contextually coherent responses based on their role settings. Inspired by this advancement in technology, we designed ClassMeta, a GPT-4 powered agent to help promote classroom participation by playing the role of an active student. These agents, which are embodied as 3D avatars in virtual reality, interact with actual instructors and students with both spoken language and body gestures. We conducted a comparative study to investigate the potential of ClassMeta for improving the overall learning experience of the class.

AB  - In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancement and adoption, and are increasingly being used in educational contexts. In this perspective article, we explore the open challenge of leveraging LLMs to create personalized learning environments that support the "whole learner" by modeling and adapting to both cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics. We identify three key challenges toward this vision: (1) improving the interpretability of LLMs' representations of whole learners, (2) implementing adaptive technologies that can leverage such representations to provide tailored pedagogical support, and (3) authoring and evaluating LLM-based educational agents. For interpretability, we discuss approaches for explaining LLM behaviors in terms of their internal representations of learners; for adaptation, we examine how LLMs can be used to provide context-aware feedback and scaffold non-cognitive skills through natural language interactions; and for authoring, we highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in using natural language instructions to specify behaviors of educational agents. Addressing these challenges will enable personalized AI tutors that can enhance learning by accounting for each student's unique background, abilities, motivations, and socioemotional needs.

AB  - Contribution: This research explores the benefits and challenges of developing, deploying, and evaluating a large language models (LLMs) chatbot, MoodleBot, in computer science classroom settings. It highlights the potential of integrating LLMs into LMSs like Moodle to support self-regulated learning (SRL) and help-seeking behavior. Background: Computer science educators face immense challenges incorporating novel tools into LMSs to create a supportive and engaging learning environment. MoodleBot addresses this challenge by offering an interactive platform for both students and teachers. Research Questions: Despite issues like bias, hallucinations, and teachers' and educators' resistance to embracing new (AI) technologies, this research investigates two questions: (RQ1) To what extent do students accept MoodleBot as a valuable tool for learning support? (RQ2) How accurately does MoodleBot churn out responses, and how congruent are these with the established course content? Methodology: This study reviews pedagogical literature on AI-driven chatbots and adopts the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for MoodleBot's design and data processing. The technology acceptance model (TAM) evaluates user acceptance through constructs like perceived usefulness (PU) and Ease of Use. Forty-six students participated, with 30 completing the TAM questionnaire. Findings: LLM-based chatbots like MoodleBot can significantly improve the teaching and learning process. This study revealed a high accuracy rate (88%) in providing course-related assistance. Positive responses from students attest to the efficacy and applicability of AI-driven educational tools. These findings indicate that educational chatbots are suitable for integration into courses to improve personalized learning and reduce teacher administrative burden, although improvements in automated fact-checking are needed.

AB  - Advancements in the generative AI field have enabled the development of powerful educational avatars. These avatars embody a human and can, for instance, listen to users' spoken input, generate an answer utilizing a large-language model, and reply by speaking with a synthetic voice. A theoretical introduction summarizes essential steps in developing AI-based educational avatars and explains how they differ from previously available educational technologies. Moreover, we introduce GPTAvatar, an open-source, state-of-the-art AI-based avatar. We then discuss the benefits of using AI-based educational avatars, which include, among other things, individualized and contextualized instruction. Afterward, we highlight the challenges of using AI-based educational avatars. Major problems concern incorrect and inaccurate information provided, as well as insufficient data protection. In the discussion, we provide an outlook by addressing advances in educational content and educational technology and identifying three crucial open questions for research and practice.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are poised to become an increasingly important part of education in the anatomical sciences. OpenAI has also introduced generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), which are customizable versions of the standard ChatGPT application. There is little research that has explored the potential of GPTs to serve as intelligent tutoring systems for learning the anatomical sciences. The objective of this study was to describe the design and explore the performance of AnatomyGPT, a customized artificial intelligence application intended for anatomical sciences education. The AnatomyGPT application was configured with GPT Builder by uploading open-source textbooks as knowledge sources and by providing pedagogical instructions for how to interact with users. The performance of AnatomyGPT was compared with ChatGPT by evaluating the responses of both applications to prompts of the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) sample items with respect to accuracy, rationales, and citations. AnatomyGPT achieved high scores on the NBME sample items for Gross Anatomy, Embryology, Histology, and Neuroscience and scored comparably to ChatGPT. In addition, AnatomyGPT provided several citations in the responses that it generated, while ChatGPT provided none. Both GPTs provided rationales for all sample items. The customized AnatomyGPT application demonstrated preliminary potential as an intelligent tutoring system by generating responses with increased citations as compared with the standard ChatGPT application. The findings of this study suggest that instructors and students may wish to create their own custom GPTs for teaching and learning anatomy. Future research is needed to further develop and characterize the potential of GPTs for anatomy education.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in engineering education has the potential to revolutionize how we teach and learn. However, it also raises many ethical and practical concerns, such as perpetuating and amplifying biases and inequalities, potential cheating issues, and even the possibility of replacing human educators altogether. While AI has already begun to enter the field of higher education, the recent introduction of new powerful AI chatbots will undoubtedly rapidly democratize the use of AI in education for both educators and students. In the current literature on AI in education, there is a lack of practical examples to help us better understand the full potential impact of AI on education. This paper addresses this gap by discussing the implementation and effectiveness of AI-powered intelligent tutoring systems in engineering education and exploring the ethical and practical considerations of their use.

AB  - This study delves into integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT-powered robots, as educational tools in primary school mathematics. Against the backdrop of Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating educational settings, our investigation focuses on the response of young learners to errors made by these LLM-powered robots. Employing a user study approach, we conducted an experiment using the Pepper robot in a primary school classroom environment, where 77 primary school students from multiple grades (Year 3 to 5) took part in interacting with the robot. Our statistically significant findings highlight that most students, regardless of the year group, could discern between correct and incorrect responses generated by the robots, demonstrating a promising level of understanding and engagement with the AI-driven educational tool. Additionally, we observed that students' correctness in answering the Maths questions significantly influenced their ability to identify errors, underscoring the importance of prior knowledge in verifying LLM responses and detecting errors. Additionally, we examined potential confounding factors such as age and gender. Our findings underscore the importance of gradually integrating AI-powered educational tools under the guidance of domain experts following thorough verification processes. Moreover, our study calls for further research to establish best practices for implementing AI-driven pedagogical approaches in educational settings.

AB  - This paper presents a qualitative, high-quality State-of-the-Art (SotA) extended literature review on integrating ChatGPT, an advanced and contemporary natural language processing model, a sophisticated AI-powered chatbot that OpenAI developed in higher education. Snyder (2019, p.1) emphasised that "a literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever". According to Barry et al (2022, p. 663), "the fundamental purpose of SotA literature review is to create a 3-part argument about the state of knowledge for a specific phenomenon: This is where we are now. This is how we got here. This is where we could go next". This 3-part argument will underpin this study. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to transform various sectors, including education, integrating AI-powered tools like ChatGPT to enhance teaching and learning has become a topic of significant interest. This study explores the diverse applications of ChatGPT in higher education, including pedagogical practices, student engagement, intelligent tutoring systems, personalised learning, language learning support, academic research, feedback, grading, and administrative support. Additionally, it identifies the challenges and ethical concerns this technology poses, focusing on bias, privacy, data security, reliability, accountability, accuracy and the balance between human interaction and artificial intelligence.

AB  - Debugging is a crucial skill for programmers, yet it can be challenging for novices to learn. The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for providing personalized debugging support to students. However, concerns have been raised about potential student over-reliance on LLM-based tools. This mixed-methods study investigates how a pedagogically-designed LLM-based chatbot supports students' debugging efforts in an introductory programming course. We conducted interviews and debugging think-aloud tasks with 20 students at three points throughout the semester. We specifically focused on characterizing when students initiate help from the chatbot during debugging, how they engage with the chatbot's responses, and how they describe their learning experiences with the chatbot. By analyzing data from the debugging tasks, we identified varying help-seeking behaviors and levels of engagement with the chatbot's responses, depending on students' familiarity with the suggested strategies. Interviews revealed that students appreciated the content and experiential knowledge provided by the chatbot, but did not view it as a primary source for learning debugging strategies. Additionally, students self-identified certain chatbot usage behaviors as negative, "non-ideal" engagement and others as positive, "learning-oriented" usage. Based on our findings, we discuss pedagogical implications and future directions for designing pedagogical chatbots to support debugging.

AB  - Pedagogical conversational agents (CA) support formal and informal learning to help students achieve better learning outcomes by providing information, guidance or fostering reflections. Even though the extant literature suggests that pedagogical CAs can improve learning outcomes, there exists little empirical evidence of what design features drive this effect. This study reports on an exploratory field experiment involving 31 pupils in commercial high schools and finds that students achieved better learning outcomes when preparing for their tests with a pedagogical CA than without. However, the drivers of this effect remain unclear. Neither the use frequency of the design features nor the pupils' expectations towards the CA could explain the improvement in marks. However, for the subjective perception of learning achievement, pupils' expectations was a significant predictor. These findings provide support for the use of pedagogical CAs in teaching but also highlight that the drivers of better learning outcomes still remain unknown.

AB  - Pedagogical agents (PAs) communicate verbally and non-verbally with students in digital and virtual reality/augmented reality learning environments. PAs have been shown to be beneficial for learning, and generative artificial intelligence, such as large language models, can improve PAs' communication abilities significantly. K-12 education is underrepresented in learning technology research and teachers' and students' insights have not been considered when developing PA communication. The current study addresses this research gap by conducting and analyzing semi-structured, in-depth interviews with eleven high school teachers and sixteen high school students about their expectations for PAs' communication capabilities. The interviewees identified relational and task-related communication capabilities that a PA should perform to communicate effectively with students and scaffold their learning. PA communication that is simultaneously affirmative and relational can induce immediacy, foster the relationship and engagement with a PA, and support students' learning management. Additionally, the teachers and students described the activities and technological aspects that should be considered when designing conversational PAs. The study showed that teachers and students applied human-tohuman communication scripts when outlining their desired PA communication characteristics. The study offers novel insights and recommendations to researchers and developers on the communicational, pedagogical, and technological aspects that must be considered when designing communicative PAs that scaffold students' learning, and discusses the contributions on human-machine communication in education.

AB  - An adaptive learning system aims to provide learning that is adapted to a learner's current status, different from the traditional classroom experience. A key element of an adaptive learning system is the recommendation system, which provides the most suitable resources based on learner profiles. Recommending the most appropriate learning resources to learners has always been a challenge in the field of e-learning. Thus, learners may have difficulties in choosing the appropriate material when faced with a large volume of recommended material during their learning process. This challenge led us to implement a chatbot to help learners improve their learning experience and knowledge. New solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). The use of our chatbot integrated in Moodle, named LearningPartnerBot, provides learners a personalized recommendation of learning objects according to two strategies, one based on their knowledge level (KL) and the other based on their learning style (LS). The objective of this article is to compare the learning outcomes obtained after the realization of the two experiments based on these two approaches centered mainly on the use of the LearningPartnerBot. Consequently, the approach of recommending learning objects based on the knowledge level gave promising results by guaranteeing a more adapted learning to the learners.

AB  - This systematic review provides unique findings with an up-to-date examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the US to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72%. Similar to the findings of other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the AIEd was intended for 72% of the studies focused on students, 17% instructors, and 11% managers. In answering the overarching question of how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools, such as Chat GPT.

AB  - Games have been successfully used to provide engaging health interventions for adolescents. However, translating health education goals into a playable game has historically taken many person-months of effort, involving game designers, scriptwriters, and artists. This work presents an exploratory study into rapidly developing physician-validated health education games for adolescents using virtual agents and LLMs. We evaluated this approach in an intervention to promote Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among adolescents, as lack of knowledge and vaccine hesitancy contribute to suboptimal HPV vaccination rates.
   We conducted a between-subjects randomized study comparing a fantasy narrative game to a non-gamified pedagogical virtual agent, with both interventions conveying the same HPV information. Among our study's 9-12-year-old adolescent participants, our findings demonstrate large pre-to-post improvements in HPV knowledge for both conditions. The gamified intervention showed higher engagement and entertainment than the pedagogical agent based on participant interviews, demonstrating that gamification enriched the educational experience for adolescents.

AB  - The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework has been used for nearly two decades to provide educators with a way to design and evaluate their online courses. Integrating generative AI (GenAI) chatbots with the CoI framework will address the current lack of clear guidelines for incorporating GenAI technology in online education. This gap is significant as GenAI in education is rapidly growing, with students showing favorable attitudes towards GenAI integration. To explore this, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted, analyzing recent studies on the use of GenAI chatbots as intelligent tutoring systems within the CoI framework. The findings revealed that GenAI chatbots enhance cognitive presence through personalized learning paths and real-time feedback, improve social presence by fostering community and continuous support, and strengthen teaching presence by automating administrative tasks and dynamic instructional strategies. These enhancements suggest that integrating GenAI chatbots can significantly enrich online learning environments, making education more dynamic, personalized, and effective. The study concludes that a seamless integration of GenAI technologies within the CoI framework can optimize digital learning ecosystems, and future research should focus on long-term impacts and ethical guidelines to ensure responsible GenAI use in education.

AB  - This study evaluates "I Learn with Prompt Engineering", a self-paced, self-regulated elective course designed to equip university students with skills in prompt engineering to effectively utilize large language models (LLMs), foster self-directed learning, and enhance academic English proficiency through generative AI applications. By integrating prompt engineering concepts with generative AI tools, the course supports autonomous learning and addresses critical skill gaps in language proficiency and market-ready capabilities. The study also examines EnSmart, an AI-driven tool powered by GPT-4 and integrated into Canvas LMS, which automates academic test content generation and grading and delivers real-time, human-like feedback. Performance evaluation, structured questionnaires, and surveys were used to evaluate the course's impact on prompting skills, academic English proficiency, and overall learning experiences. Results demonstrated significant improvements in prompt engineering skills, with accessible patterns like "Persona" proving highly effective, while advanced patterns such as "Flipped Interaction" posed challenges. Gains in academic English were most notable among students with lower initial proficiency, though engagement and practice time varied. Students valued EnSmart's intuitive integration and grading accuracy but identified limitations in question diversity and adaptability. The high final success rate demonstrated that proper course design (taking into consideration Panadero's four dimensions of self-regulated learning) can facilitate successful autonomous learning. The findings highlight generative AI's potential to enhance autonomous learning and task automation, emphasizing the necessity of human oversight for ethical and effective implementation in education.

AB  - AI-generated virtual instructors powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment online learning by making it more interactive and personalized. In this work, we focus specifically on applying this technology to financial literacy education, a critical life skill that is unfortunately undertaught in most school systems. To investigate this potential, we developed three conditions for delivering financial education: A) a Passive Virtual Instructor, B) an Interactive Virtual Instructor powered by LLMs to enable two-way conversation with the learner, and C) a Personally Selected Interactive Virtual Instructor, allowing learners to choose their preferred AI instructor. In a study with 90 participants aged 18-25, we found that incorporating interactivity significantly improved learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and humanness compared to the passive agent. The ability to personally select an instructor provided little additional benefit for most measures. These results highlight the potential of interactive virtual instructors for enhancing motivational and experiential factors, even if comprehension itself is unaffected.

AB  - The ability of children to ask curiosity-driven questions is an important skill that helps improve their learning. For this reason, previous research has explored designing specific exercises to train this skill. Several of these studies relied on providing semantic and linguistic cues to train them to ask more of such questions (also called divergent questions). But despite showing pedagogical efficiency, this method is still limited as it relies on generating the said cues by hand, which can be a very long and costly process. In this context, we propose to leverage advances in the natural language processing field (NLP) and investigate the efficiency of using a large language model (LLM) for automating the production of key parts of pedagogical content within a curious question-asking (QA) training. We study generating the said content using the "prompt-based" method that consists of explaining the task to the LLM in natural text. We evaluate the output using human experts annotations and comparisons with hand-generated content. Results suggested indeed the relevance and usefulness of this content. We then conduct a field study in primary school (75 children aged 9-10), where we evaluate children's QA performance when having this training. We compare 3 types of content: 1) hand-generated content that proposes "closed" cues leading to predefined questions; 2) GPT-3-generated content that proposes the same type of cues; 3) GPT-3-generated content that proposes "open" cues leading to several possible questions. Children were assigned to either one of these groups. Based on human annotations of the questions generated, we see a similar QA performance between the two "closed" trainings (showing the scalability of the approach using GPT-3), and a better one for participants with the "open" training. These results suggest the efficiency of using LLMs to support children in generating more curious questions, using a natural language prompting approach that affords usability by teachers and other users not specialists of AI techniques. Furthermore, results also show that open-ended content may be more suitable for training curious question-asking skills.

AB  - Educational AI systems often do not employ proper sophistication techniques to enhance learner interactions, organize their contextual knowledge or even deliver personalized feedback. To address this gap, this paper seeks to reform the way ChatGPT supports learners by employing fuzzy memory retention and thematic clustering. To achieve this, three modules have been developed: (a) the Fuzzy Memory Module which models human memory retention using time decay fuzzy weights to assign relevance to user interactions, (b) the Schema Manager which then organizes these prioritized interactions into thematic clusters for structured contextual representation, and (c) the Response Generator which uses the output of the other two modules to provide feedback to ChatGPT by synthesizing personalized responses. The synergy of these three modules is a novel approach to intelligent and AI tutoring that enhances the output of ChatGPT to learners for a more personalized learning experience. The system was evaluated by 120 undergraduate students in the course of Java programming, and the results are very promising, showing memory retrieval accuracy, schema relevance and personalized response quality. The results also show the system outperforms traditional methods in delivering adaptive and contextually enriched educational feedback.

AB  - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) are frequently used for educational assessments for their efficiency in grading and providing feedback. However, manually generatingMCQs has some limitations and challenges. This study explores an AI-driven approach to creating and evaluating Bloom's Taxonomy-aligned college-level biology MCQs using a varied number of shots in few-shot prompting with GPT-4. Shots, or examples of correct prompt-response pairs, were sourced from previously published datasets containing educator-approved MCQs labeled with their Bloom's taxonomy and were matched to prompts via a maximal marginal relevance search. To obtain ground truths to compare GPT-4 against, three expert human evaluators with a minimum of 4 years of educational experience annotated a random sample of the generated questions with regards to relevance to the input prompt, classroom usability, and perceived Bloom's Taxonomy level. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of an AI-driven evaluation approach that can rate question usability using the Item Writing Flaws (IWFs) framework. We conclude that GPT-4 generally shows promise in generating relevant and usable questions. However, more work needs to be done to improve Bloom-level alignment accuracy (accuracy of alignment between GPT-4's target level and the actual level of the generated question). Moreover, we note that a general inverse relationship exists between alignment accuracy and number of shots. On the other hand, no clear trend between shot number and relevance/usability was observed. These findings shed light on automated question generation and assessment, presenting the potential for advancements in AI-driven educational evaluation methods.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are next-word predictors built on large language models (LLMs). There is great interest within the educational field for this new technology because AI chatbots can be used to generate information. In this theoretical article, we provide educational insights into the possibilities and challenges of using AI chatbots. These insights were produced by designing chemical information-seeking activities for chemistry teacher education which were analyzed via the SWOT approach. The analysis revealed several internal and external possibilities and challenges. The key insight is that AI chatbots will change the way learners interact with information. For example, they enable the building of personal learning environments with ubiquitous access to information and AI tutors. Their ability to support chemistry learning is impressive. However, the processing of chemical information reveals the limitations of current AI chatbots not being able to process multimodal chemical information. There are also ethical issues to address. Despite the benefits, wider educational adoption will take time. The diffusion can be supported by integrating LLMs into curricula, relying on open-source solutions, and training teachers with modern information literacy skills. This research presents theory-grounded examples of how to support the development of modern information literacy skills in the context of chemistry teacher education.

AB  - As education constitutes an essential development standard for individuals and societies, researchers have been exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain and have embedded the technology within it through a myriad of applications. In order to provide a detailed overview of the efforts, this article pays particular attention to these developments by highlighting key application areas of data-driven AI in education; it also analyzes existing tools, research trends, as well as limitations of the role data-driven AI can play in education. In particular, this article reviews various applications of AI in education including student grading and assessments, student retention and drop-out predictions, sentiment analysis, intelligent tutoring, classroom monitoring, and recommender systems. This article also provides a detailed bibliometric analysis to highlight the salient research trends in AI in education over nine years (2014-2022) and further provides a detailed description of the tools and platforms developed as the outcome of research and development efforts in AI in education. For the bibliometric analysis, articles from several top venues are analyzed to explore research trends in the domain. The analysis shows sufficient contribution in the domain from different parts of the world with a clear lead for the United States. Moreover, students' grading and evaluation have been observed as the most widely explored application. Despite the significant success, we observed several aspects of education where AI alone has not contributed much. We believe such detailed analysis is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain.

AB  - General-purpose Language Models (LMs) bypass the need for task-specific model training by allowing textual prompts to specify a downstream task (e.g., assessment, feedback generation). One of the main benefits of using a prompt-based learning method is that it circumvents the need for supervised data and training on the downstream task. However, in high-stakes settings like education, LMs need to be evaluated rigorously on the specific downstream tasks before putting them in front of the students. Unlike traditional supervised learning models that are evaluated for a specific task, LMs are often evaluated on benchmark data and tasks that may not reflect the downstream use in education. Hence, we first present arguments for contextual evaluation of LMs. Next, we present a framework for behavior analysis - an alternative approach for model evaluation. Behavior analysis involves defining LM behaviors and designing tests (e.g., invariance to irrelevant perturbations). Using a case study of assessing science ideas in student essays, with past data from ecologically valid contexts, we illustrate how behavior analysis allowed for the identification of LM failures that are likely to go unnoticed in tests for generalization. By making the LMs more transparent for scrutiny, this study suggests a way to improve LM reliability and trustworthiness. Future studies will work with education stakeholders in translating their implicit expectations of desired model behaviors into explicitly defined tests, thereby building their agency and trust in educational AI.

KW  - BELIEFS
AB  - Conversational AI (C-AI), like OpenAI's ChatGPT [38] or Google's Gemini [1], has seen a surge in development in recent years, driven by advancements in large language models. C-AI has the unique capability to instantaneously communicate with others using vast and contextual knowledge, providing personalized assistance tailored to individual needs. While the specific applications and advantages of conversational technologies are still being explored, prior research has noted the potential for conversational agents to serve in pedagogical settings, such as teaching agents, collaborative partners, or motivational tools [13, 30]. The successful development and implementation of pedagogical C-AI relies on an understanding of learners' perceptions, trust, and overall acceptance of C-AI. There is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing learners' trust and acceptance of this emerging technology.
   Grounded in the theories proposed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [16], the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [47], and Mayer, Davis and Schoorman's model of organizational trust [35], this paper proposes a model of learners' acceptance and trust for C-AI. The proposed model integrates factors relating to learners' perceptions and trust of C-AI, and additionally, four groups of moderating variables (e.g. individual characteristics). The proposed model hypothesizes that learners' perceptions and trust significantly influence their acceptance and behavioral intention to use C-AI. The relationships between learners' perceptions, trust, and acceptance are additionally proposed to be influenced by four groups of moderating variables: individual characteristics, AI characteristics, facilitating conditions, and subjective norms.
   To validate the proposed model, we plan to collect survey data and leverage structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. We will specifically evaluate the fitness of the proposed model through chi-square tests, RMSEA, CFI, and SRMR metrics. This study can provide valuable insights toward the scalable adoption and usage of C-AI in learning environments. Understanding the structural relationships between the factors that influence learners' acceptance and trust of pedagogical C-AI will be crucial for designing and deploying these technologies in ways that foster learners' engagement, self-efficacy, academic interest, and ultimately lead to positive learning outcomes.

AB  - Chatbots can have a significant positive impact on learning. There is a growing interest in their application in teaching and learning. The self-regulation of learning is fundamental for the development of lifelong learning skills, and for this reason, education should contribute to its development. In this sense, the potential of chatbot technologies for supporting students to self-regulate their learning activity has already been pointed out. The objective of this work is to explore university students' interactions with EDUguia chatbot to understand whether there are patterns of use linked to phases of self-regulated learning and academic task completion. This study presents an analysis of conversation pathways with a chatbot tutor to enhance self-regulation skills in higher education. Some relevant findings on the length, duration, and endpoints of the conversations are shared. In addition, patterns in these pathways and users' interactions with the tool are analysed. Some findings are relevant to the analysis of the link between design and user experience, but they can also be related to implementation decisions. The findings presented could contribute to the work of other educators, designers, and developers interested in developing a tool addressing this goal.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support self-regulated learning (SRL) because of its strong anthropomorphic characteristics. However, most studies of AI in education have focused on cognitive outcomes in higher education, and little research has examined how psychological needs affect SRL with AI in the K-12 setting. SRL is a self-directed process driven by psychological factors that can be explained by the three basic needs of self-determination theory (SDT), i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This study fills a research gap by examining the moderating effects of need satisfaction and gender in predicting SRL among Grade 9 students. The results indicate that girls perceive more need support than boys. In predicting SRL, satisfaction of the need for autonomy and competence is moderated by both gender and AI knowledge, whereas satisfaction of the need for relatedness is moderated by gender only. Particularly among girls, the effects of autonomy and competence more strongly predict SRL when AI knowledge is low. These findings confirm the gender differences in need satisfaction when predicting SRL with a chatbot. The findings have implications for both teacher instruction and the design and development of intelligent learning environments.

AB  - The recent emergence of generative AI (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Gemini have introduced revolutionary capabilities that are predicted to transform numerous facets of society fundamentally. In higher education (HE), the advent of GenAI presents a pivotal moment that may profoundly alter learning and teaching practices in aspects such as inaccuracy, bias, overreliance on technology and algorithms, and limited access to educational AI resources that require in-depth investigation. To evaluate the implications of adopting GenAI in HE, a team of academics and field experts have co-authored this paper, which analyzes the potential for the responsible integration of GenAI into HE and provides recommendations about this integration. This paper recommends strategies for integrating GenAI into HE to create the following positive outcomes: raise awareness about disruptive change, train faculty, change teaching and assessment practices, partner with students, impart AI learning literacies, bridge the digital divide, and conduct applied research. Finally, we propose four preliminary scale levels of a GenAI adoption for faculty. At each level, we suggest courses of action to facilitate progress to the next stage in the adoption of GenAI. This study offers a valuable set of recommendations to decision-makers and faculty, enabling them to prepare for the responsible and judicious integration of GenAI into HE.

AB  - The Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) has gained widespread acceptance in higher education as an effective pedagogical strategy. Despite its success, the FCM still faces persistent concerns, including a lack of personalized interaction, limited application to introductory courses, and insufficient analysis of the learning process. The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) with the Metaverse may significantly enrich and revitalize FCM by introducing affordances that support personalized and immersive learning experiences. This study examined the potential of FCM enhanced by an AI-Generated Metaverse (AIGM) to improve learning outcomes in higher education. Through introducing an AI-powered virtual tutor, this study aimed to address existing concerns and shed light on the nature of knowledge-building interactions between students and the AI tutor. The study involved 94 university graduates who participated in an experimental FCM session. Data on students' learning performance were collected through pre/posttests, pre-class video engagement, and analyzed dialogic interactions between students and the AI virtual tutor. The findings indicated that the AIGM-FCM positively influenced learners' academic performance. Interaction patterns revealed that students predominantly engaged with the AI virtual tutor at the onset and at the end of their learning sessions, primarily for the purpose of asking questions. However, the educational dialogues suggested that the depth of collaborative knowledge construction between students and the AI tutor remained at a basic level. Notably, students with lower academic performance were more likely to initiate inquiry-based dialogues with the AI tutor compared to their higher-achieving peers exhibiting a more focusing-oriented approach. In light of these discussions, the implications of this study are also deliberated.

AB  - Pedagogical agent is a software agent that provides guidance, feedback, or intervention to learners in digital environments. It has the potential to address issues in computer-based learning, particularly online learning, which often neglects affective aspects, such as the emotions of its users. Most systematic literature reviews (SLR) on pedagogical agent have focused on their visual design, types of feedback, and other empirical elements. However, what underlies these agents' ability to provide interventions personalized to learner's emotions has not been examined. So, this SLR explores how pedagogical agent has addressed learner's emotional needs. The study's research questions include: 1) To what extent does research exist on models, frameworks, or architectures for pedagogical agent, especially those related to emotions? 2) How are pedagogical agent represented, what types of interventions do they use, and how do they affect learner's emotions? 3) What kinds of inputs are used to activate the pedagogical agent's functions? This SLR applied the Kitchenham method to select reference sources from 2013 to 2023 and was indexed by Scopus in the Q1 to Q4 range. Our review revealed the absence of a specific model for mapping out interventions tailored to the learner's emotional needs. Most existing pedagogical agent provide learning interventions that are less adaptive and personalized based on the learner's emotional state and are applied to asynchronous learning systems such as e-learning. There are still very few pedagogical agents that use real-time input technology by utilizing artificial intelligence to recognize learner's emotion to trigger an adaptive and personalized intervention.

AB  - With the recent advancement in technology, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can produce hyper-realistic multimedia content, such as audio, text, images, and videos. Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners' retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its human-like qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education.

AB  - This paper presents an innovative approach to designing Intelligent Learning Assistants (ILAs) named GITTE (Great Individual TuTor Embodiment), focusing on their visual representation and personalisation. The significance of visual representations for ILAs is explored, underlining their impact on learning outcomes and student perceptions. The presented approach introduces a novel, exploratory, and participatory method for identifying influential design features in ILAs using the Pedagogical Agents-Levels of Design (PALD) model and generative AI models like DALL-E and ChatGPT. This method allows for the exploration of design features not previously considered, capturing unconscious student preferences. The paper documents the initial test involving a manual approach to evaluate the applicability of generative AI models in designing GITTE, emphasizing the interaction between students and the generative model. The results indicate the potential of this approach in enhancing the personalisation and effectiveness of ILAs, suggesting new directions for research in this emerging field. The concept presented is poised to make significant contributions to the development of more engaging and personalized digital learning aids.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a systematic review dealing with the use of personas, avatars, and characters in conjunction with AI-supported tools such as chatbots or generative AI in education. Although the use generative AI in education is gaining traction, this study seeks to systematically review the body of knowledge dealing with personified and conversational approaches to education with both pre-generative and generative AI. The results of the study emphasize the importance of the three key elements of such systems: the use of pedagogical agents, interaction, and personalization. These key elements can be relevant when considering the adoption of the new generation of generative AI in education. Such systems should scaffold learners' understanding providing guidance and support, promote self-directedness and ensure effectiveness in learning, provide customized learning paths, and promote ethical use.

AB  - Notwithstanding the growing advantages of incorporating Augmented Reality (AR) in science education, the pedagogical use of AR combined with Pedagogical Agents (PAs) remains underexplored. Additionally, few studies have examined the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into science education to create GAI-enhanced PAs (GPAs) that enrich the learning experiences. To address these gaps, this study designed and implemented a GPA-enhanced 5E model within AR environments to scaffold students' science learning. A mixed-methods design was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on students' academic achievement, cognitive load, and their perceptions of GPAs as learning aids through using the 5E model. Sixty sixth-grade students from two complete classes were randomly assigned to either an experimental group engaged in AR science learning with a GPA-enhanced 5E approach or a control group that followed the traditional 5E method. The findings revealed that the GPA-enhanced 5E approach in AR environments significantly improved students' academic achievement and decreased cognitive load. Furthermore, students in the experimental group reported positive perceptions of the GPA-enhanced 5E method during the AR science lessons. The findings offer valuable insights for instructional designers and educators who leverage advanced educational technologies to support science learning aligned with constructivist principles.

AB  - The advent of generative AI has caused both excitement and anxiety among educators. Some school systems have gone so far as to ban it altogether. Generative AI has the potential to transform human learning; but like any new technology, it has both strengths and weaknesses, and adopting it involves some risks. There are risks that generative AI will mislead learners with wrong information, or that learners will use it to do their homework and take tests for them. This article presents some ways to take best advantage of generative AI, while managing and mitigating the risks. It also suggests some uses of generative AI to avoid. These insights are informed by learning science and extensive experience developing AI-enabled learning products. If applied properly, generative AI can dramatically accelerate human learning and do so at scale.

AB  - Given the considerable importance of the English language as a common method of global communication, supporting and engaging learning environments for studying English as a second language are essential. In this study, we propose an interactive agent that considers differences in learners' skill levels to help motivate learners and support independent study. The proposed agent is an AI chatbot that can vary the complexity of its natural language interactions as learners' skills improve and engage in unstructured conversations with users. We first collected a dataset of English conversations among children and then acquired data on learners' utterances of words and sentences using an interactive interface for skill evaluation. Based on these datasets, we generated a set of personalized conversational agents by using algorithms to evaluate speakers' pronunciation and sentences. Finally, an expert in English language learning evaluated the interactive system to ensure that it could support learners with different levels of proficiency and that the application may be expected to help motivate students to learn. The results showed that the interactive teachable agent could help motivate students who may not otherwise be interested in learning by using a more personalized approach tailored to their skill level.

AB  - Automated written corrective feedback (AWCF) has been widely applied in second language (L2) writing classrooms in the past few decades. Recently, the introduction of tools based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) such as ChatGPT heralds groundbreaking changes in the conceptualization and practice of AWCF in L2 pedagogy. However, students' engagement in such an interactive and intelligent learning environment remains unstudied. The present study aims to investigate L2 writers' behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement with ChatGPT as an AWCF provider for writing products. This mixed-method multiple case study explored four L2 writers' behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement with AWCF provided by ChatGPT. Bearing the conversational and generative mechanisms of ChatGPT in mind, data on students' engagement were collected from various sources: prompt writing techniques, revision operations, utilization of metacognitive and cognitive strategies, and attitudinal responses to the feedback. The results indicated that: 1) behavioral engagement was related to their individual differences in language proficiencies and technological competencies; 2) the participants have failed to metacognitively regulate the learning processes in an effective manner; and 3) ChatGPT ushered in an affectively engaging, albeit competence-demanding and time-consuming, learning environment for L2 writers. The study delivers conceptual and pedagogical implications for educators and researchers poised to incorporate GAI-based technologies in language education.

AB  - The History of Design course is a foundational component for art and design students; however, many students perceive it as abstract and unengaging, mainly due to its highly conceptual nature and traditional lecture-based teaching methods. To address these challenges, this study investigates the impact of AI-generated virtual instructors and a conversational teaching style on academic achievement, cognitive load, and student engagement in the flipped classroom. This study employed a 2 x 2 experimental design, with 124 first-year design students randomly assigned to four experimental conditions: human-formal (HF), human-conversational (HC), AI-generated-formal (AF), and AI-generated-conversational (AC). The results indicate that the AI-generated virtual instructor significantly enhances affective engagement and has a comparably beneficial effect on academic performance and cognitive load compared to the human instructor. Furthermore, the conversational teaching style considerably improves students' academic performance, reduces cognitive load, and fosters engagement. These findings suggest that integrating generative AI tools with conversational teaching style within a flipped classroom model not only optimizes students' learning experiences but also offers a practical framework for reducing educators' workloads while contributing valuable insights into the application of generative AI in education.

AB  - Educational chatbots have been shown to be useful assistants in computersupported learning settings. However, how does feedback of an educational chatbot impact on the learner's attention? Thus, this paper proposes a study to measure changes in human attention when learning by using an educational chatbot Liza that is intended to improve human reasoning ability. In total, 18 participants participated in the study and had a conversation with Liza. During the interaction with Liza, the attention of the study participants was measured using a mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) device. Three findings have been determined based on statistics methods. First, it was found that there was a significant attention effect occurring in 54% of the times, after the educational chatbot showed feedback and the attention measurement took place over the length of a task. Second, when differentiating the type of feedback, positive feedback had a significant effect in 71 of these 137 cases (51.82%) and negative feedback had a significant effect in 66 of the 137 cases (48.18%). Third, statistical results showed that there was no significant difference in attention at the significant level of 0.05 during the 10 seconds before, and 10 seconds after positive feedback is received. Similar is the case for negative feedback.

AB  - Conversational agents can deepen reasoning and encourage students to build on others' knowledge in collaborative learning. Embedding agents in group work, however, presents challenges where groups may ignore the agents, and this calls for designs where students perceive agents as learning partners. This study examines group interactions with two text-based agents (ie, chatbots) that posed as an expert and a less knowledgeable peer in a high school marine biology lesson. Student messages (N = 1764) from 18 groups (52 students ages 14-15) received codes for reasoning, building on prior ideas, and responsiveness to the agents. Results indicate no differences between agents in how often each discussion move occurred. Interestingly, sequential pattern mining suggests that the less-knowledgeable-peer agent prompted groups to show questioning and building on others' ideas, similar to how students may act as peer tutors to the agent. Meanwhile, sequences with the expert agent resembled student-teacher exchange, where groups responded to the agent's nudges and then provided reasoning. Findings illustrate the affordances of embedding humanized features in technology designs to promote discussion.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of chatbot-based writing practices on second language learners' writing performance and perceptions of using the chatbot in L2 writing practices. A total of 75 Korean elementary school students were randomly allocated to two groups. While the control group received traditional teacher-led writing instruction, the experimental group used a chatbot for individual writing practices for 15 weeks. The chatbot was developed using Google's Dialogflow machine-learning AI platform by encoding expressions from an elementary school English textbook. A pretest was carried out prior to the experiment to examine the initial writing performance, and a posttest was carried out 15 weeks later with a different writing topic. The participants in the experimental group also responded to a short survey to report their perceptions and opinions about the chatbot. The results showed that the two groups generally showed a similar writing proficiency in the pretest scores, but the experimental group performed significantly better in the posttest than the control group, suggesting that the chatbot-based writing practice had a facilitating effect on their test performance. The participants of the experimental group also found the chatbot useful in improving their language skills and made them feel comfortable when learning a foreign language.

AB  - ABS T R A C T Conversational agents can facilitate learning discussions by applying natural language under-standing to process students' discourse. Agents can assume the roles of figures such as peers or mentors, to promote actions similar to human interactions. In this study, we explore how and for whom different role designs of a text-based agent (i.e., chatbot) can facilitate discussion patterns and systems thinking in small-group discussions. Participants included 172 students in 9th grade (ages 13-14). Participants were randomly assigned to groups of five students and interacted with no agent, an expert agent, or a less knowledgeable peer agent. Results suggest that both agents facilitated learning of systems mechanisms by enhancing transactive exchange, where students built on prior ideas in their discussion groups. We also found differences in the agents' effects on discussion and learning outcomes based on groups' variation in systems thinking pre-test. Find-ings highlight the importance of role design considerations of agents in group settings.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) has been integrated into foreign language (FL) education, learners' well-being is influenced by various factors, including technological, personal and contextual elements. However, few studies explored how external and internal factors jointly shape FL learners' well-being in the era of generative AI. To fill this gap, this study explores the effects of generative AI acceptance, perceived teachers' enthusiasm and self-efficacy on FL learners' well-being by investigating 613 university learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). The structural equation modelling results reveal that (1) generative AI acceptance positively predicts EFL learners' well-being and self-efficacy; (2) perceived teachers' enthusiasm does not predict learners' well-being and positively predicts EFL learners' self-efficacy; and (3) the self-efficacy for receptive skills mediates the relationship between generative AI acceptance/perceived teachers' enthusiasm and EFL learners' well-being, whereas self-efficacy for productive skills does not play the mediation role. This research broadens the understanding of the antecedents of EFL learners' well-being and extends the application of self-efficacy theory in the AI-driven educational environment, providing significant pedagogical implications.

Analyses revealed a significant improvement in question quality from initial submissions to later stages. Specifically, participants progressed from Level 1 questions (simple recall) to Level 5 questions (creative and evaluative), based on Bloom's Taxonomy. However, participants who began with lower-quality questions showed varied progression paths to higher levels. To analyze the data, a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) was used to account for both fixed and random effects, revealing a statistically significant improvement in question quality over time (p < .01). ANOVA results further confirmed the significance of question stage on quality, and a Least Squares Means (LSMEANS) analysis indicated a precise and significant improvement in later-stage questions. Additionally, survey responses highlighted participants' appreciation for the ongoing development of AI-driven educational tools like Ask.SMILE. Several implications and future research directions are explored, including the potential to expand the platform's features beyond question evaluation.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are poised to have a profound impact on medical education. Medical students, as early adopters of technology and future health care providers, play a crucial role in shaping the future of health care. However, little is known about the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use AI chatbots among medical students in China. Objective: This study aims to explore the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use generative AI chatbots among medical students in China, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. By conducting a national cross-sectional survey, we sought to identify the key determinants that influence medical students' acceptance of AI chatbots, thereby providing a basis for enhancing their integration into medical education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators, policy makers, and technology developers to design and implement effective AI-driven educational tools that align with the needs and expectations of future health care professionals. Methods: A web-based electronic survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via social media to medical students across the country. The UTAUT was used as a theoretical framework to design the questionnaire and analyze the data. The relationship between behavioral intention to use AI chatbots and UTAUT predictors was examined using multivariable regression. Results: A total of 693 participants were from 57 universities covering 21 provinces or municipalities in China. Only a minority (199/693, 28.72%) reported using AI chatbots for studying, with ChatGPT (129/693, 18.61%) being the most commonly used. Most of the participants used AI chatbots for quickly obtaining medical information and knowledge (631/693, 91.05%) and increasing learning efficiency (594/693, 85.71%). Utilization behavior, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, and personal innovativeness showed significant positive associations with the behavioral intention to use AI Conclusions: Chinese medical students hold positive perceptions toward and high intentions to use AI chatbots, but there are gaps between intention and actual adoption. This highlights the need for strategies to improve access, training, and support and provide peer usage examples to fully harness the potential benefits of chatbot technology.

AB  - This paper presents a strategy designed to evaluate AI-supplemented teaching and learning in a course belonging to a master program in Computer Science at the University of South-Eastern Norway. The strategy was closely related to the delivery format adopted in this program, where students take only one course at a time. Each course lasts for 6 weeks, comprising an initial "reading week", an "intensive lectures" week, a 3-week "project assignment", and one "assessment week". The university supported the cost of OpenAI Plus account subscriptions offered to each student while the course was running, and specific activities were proposed to the class exploring the different ways in which AI tutoring could be used during each one of the 4 phases included in the course work plan. The strategy can be adapted to other program delivery formats by redistributing the proposed activities in accordance with the planned sequence of learning activities. It is also independent of which generative AI tool is selected, although OpenAI Plus accounts allow access to specific features that offer relevant pedagogical benefits, e.g., a simple process to create private language models that are easily customizable to each course subject.

AB  - Ongoing advancements in generative AI (GenAI) have boosted the potential of applying long-standing "learning-by-teaching" practices in the form of a teachable agent (TA). Despite the recognized roles and opportunities of TAs, less is known about how GenAI could create synergy or introduce challenges in TAs and how students perceived the application of GenAI in TAs. This study explored middle school students' perceived roles, benefits, and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs in an authentic mathematics classroom. Through classroom observation, focus-group interviews, and open-ended surveys of 108 sixth-grade students, we found that students expected the GenAI-powered TA to serve as a learning companion, facilitator, and collaborative problem-solver. Students also expressed the benefits and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs. This study provides implications for the design of educational AI and AI-assisted instruction.

AB  - We analyzed the communication patterns of Cipherbot, an educational AI chatbot that addresses validation and transparency problems in AI-student interaction, with 44 undergraduate business students using the system. Findings show that Cipherbot delivers information grounded in learning materials, primarily focusing on statements of fact, with a 99% occurrence rate. Also, about a third (31%) of Cipherbot's messages to students contain an example, which adheres to pedagogical best practices. However, more than a third (36%) of Cipherbot's communication with students also contained traces of opinion, particularly normative statements about how companies or individuals should behave. Cipherbot also demonstrates some level of social etiquette, using thank yous and apologies (7%), but it rarely engages in requests for information, or clarifications and comprehension checks-as these categories might be useful for student engagement, future exploration into diversifying Cipherbot's communication style to support learning is required. Student feedback suggests that usability issues in educational AI chatbots comprise both communicational and technical issues, e.g., incompleteness and redundancy-iterative testing of prompts with student feedback could address many of these challenges. Based on our findings, we make six propositions about students' interaction with educational AI chatbots.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in K-12 social studies education presents a complex blend of opportunities and challenges. This paper explores the transformative potential and ethical dilemmas of employing AI, particularly in engaging with historical primary sources. Utilizing a Delphi methodology, this study captures insights from social studies educators on AI's role in enhancing or complicating the teaching and learning process. The research reveals the transformative potential of AI to deepen historical understanding and empathy through innovative tools, yet it also underscores significant concerns about the accuracy, representation of historical events and figures, and the authenticity of educational content. This exploration presents the paradox inherent in educational AI: its ability to radically transform learning experiences with innovative tools while also threatening to obscure the distinction between historical accuracy and fabrication. The emerging capabilities of generative AI prompt vital questions concerning the legitimacy of information, trustworthiness, and authenticity in historical representation. We consider the implications of AI for pedagogy, emphasizing the need for instructional approaches that engage students in the critical analysis of complex influences shaping historical narratives and visual representations. The paper also addresses the role of AI in perpetuating or challenging historical narratives and biases. It underscores the importance of critical theory in social studies education to analyze the impact of synthetic media and conversational AI agents on students' perceptions of history. We emphasize the need for collaboration between educators, technologists, and historians to ensure that AI tools enrich the educational landscape without compromising the integrity and complexity of historical understanding.

AB  - Introduction Therapeutic education for patients with asthma has been shown to reduce asthma morbidity. The high availability of smart phones provides the opportunity to furnish patient training via specifically designed chatbot applications. The goal of this protocol is to perform a first pilot comparison of traditional face to face versus chatbot-guided patient therapeutic education programmes for patients with asthma.Methods and analysis Eighty adult patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of asthma will be enrolled in a two-parallel-arm, randomised (1:1) controlled pilot trial. A single-Zelen consent procedure is deployed to first enrol all participants in the comparator arm, that is, the standard patient therapeutic education programme at the University Hospitals of Montpellier, France. This means of patient therapeutic education is based on reoccurring interviews and discussion with qualified nursing staff as per usual care. Following baseline data acquisition, randomisation will be performed. Those patients randomised to the comparator arm will not be informed of the second arm. Those patients randomised to the experimental arm will be proposed access to a specifically designed chatbot (Vik-Asthme) as the second tested means of patient training (refusals continue with standard training, though analysed as intention to treat). The primary outcome is change in the total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score at the end of follow-up (6 months). Secondary outcomes cover asthma control, spirometry, general health status, programme adherence and burden for medical staff, exacerbations and medical resource use (medications, consults, emergency visits, hospitalisation and intensive care).Ethics and dissemination This study ('AsthmaTrain' protocol version 4-20220330) has been approved by the Committee for the Protection of Persons Ile-de-France VII on 28 March 2022 (reference number 21.03617.000059). Enrolment began on 24 May 2022. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals.
